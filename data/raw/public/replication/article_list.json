Thus, modeling the trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein evolution could have value for mRNA vaccine development. Traditionally, in silico sequence evolution has been modeled discretely, while there has been limited investigation into continuous models. Here we present the Viral Predictor for mRNA Evolution (VPRE), an open-source software tool which learns from mutational patterns in viral proteins and models their most statistically likely evolutionary trajectories. We trained a variational autoencoder with real-time and simulated SARS-CoV-2 genome data from Australia to encode discrete spike protein sequences into continuous numerical variables. To simulate evolution along a phylogenetic path, we trained a Gaussian process model with the numerical variables to project spike protein evolution up to five months in advance. Our predictions mapped primarily to a sequence that differed by a single amino acid from the most reported spike protein in Australia within the prediction timeframe, indicating the utility of deep learning and continuous latent spaces for modeling viral protein evolution.

Previously, we identified that the domain immediately downstream of the S2 cleavage site is the bona fide FP (amino acids 798-835) for SARS-1 using ESR spectroscopy technology. We also found that the SARS-1 FP induces membrane ordering in a Ca2+ dependent fashion. In this study, we want to know which residues are involved in this Ca2+ binding, to build a topological model and to understand the role of the Ca2+. We performed a systematic mutation study on the negatively charged residues on the SARS-1 FP. While all six negatively charged residues contributes to the membrane ordering activity of the FP to some extent, D812 is the most important residue. We provided a topological model of how the FP binds Ca2+ ions: both FP1 and FP2 bind one Ca2+ ion, and there are two binding sites in FP1 and three in FP2. We also found that the corresponding residue D830 in the SARS-2 FP plays a similar critical role. ITC experiments show that the binding energies between the FP and Ca2+ as well as between the FP and membranes also decreases for all mutants. The binding of Ca2+, the folding of FP and the ordering activity correlated very well across the mutants, suggesting that the function of the Ca2+ is to help to folding of FP in membranes to enhance its activity. Using a novel pseudotyped virus particle (PP)-liposome methodology, we monitored the membrane ordering induced by the FPs in the whole S proteins in its trimer form in real time. We found that the SARS-1 and SARS-2 PPs also induce membrane ordering as the separate FPs do, and the mutations of the negatively charged residues also greatly reduce the membrane ordering activity. However, the difference in kinetic between the PP and FP indicates a possible role of FP trimerization.

Variants of concern (VOCs) have emerged which may affect transmissibility, disease severity and re-infection risk. Most studies focus on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein. However, some studies suggest that the Spike N-terminal domain (NTD) may have a role in facilitating virus entry via sialic-acid receptor binding. Furthermore, most VOCs include novel NTD variants. Recent analyses demonstrated that NTD insertions in VOCs tend to lie close to loop regions likely to be involved in binding sialic acids. We extended the structural characterisation of these putative sugar binding pockets and explored whether variants could enhance the binding to sialic acids and therefore to the host membrane, thereby contributing to increased transmissibility. We found that recent NTD insertions in VOCs (i.e., Gamma, Delta and Omicron variants) and emerging variants of interest (VOIs) (i.e., Iota, Lambda, Theta variants) frequently lie close to known and putative sugar-binding pockets. For some variants, including the recent Omicron VOC, we find increases in predicted sialic acid binding energy, compared to the original SARS-CoV-2, which may contribute to increased transmission. We examined the similarity of NTD across a range of related Betacoronaviruses to determine whether the putative sugar-binding pockets are sufficiently similar to be exploited in drug design. Despite global sequence and structure similarity, most sialic-acid binding pockets of NTD vary across related coronaviruses. Typically, SARS-CoV-2 possesses additional loops in these pockets that increase contact with polysaccharides. Our work suggests ongoing evolutionary tuning of the sugar-binding pockets in the virus. Whilst three of the pockets are too structurally variable to be amenable to pan Betacoronavirus drug design, we detected a fourth pocket that is highly structurally conserved and could therefore be investigated in pursuit of a generic drug. Our structure-based analyses help rationalise the effects of VOCs and provide hypotheses for experiments. For example, the Omicron variant, which has increased binding to sialic acids in pocket 3, has a rather unique insertion near pocket 3.

The strongest IFN antagonist is the accessory protein ORF6, which localizes to multiple membranous compartments, including the nuclear envelope, where it directly binds the nuclear pore components Nup98-Rae1 to inhibit nuclear translocation of activated STAT1/IRF3 transcription factors. However, a direct cause-and-effect relationship between ORF6 localization and IFN antagonism has yet to be explored experimentally. Here, we use extensive mutagenesis studies to define the structural determinants required for steady-state localization and demonstrate that mis-localized ORF6 variants can still potently inhibit nuclear trafficking and IFN signaling. Additionally, expression of a peptide that mimics the ORF6/Nup98 interaction domain robustly inhibited nuclear trafficking. Furthermore, pharmacologic and mutational approaches combined to suggest that ORF6 is likely a peripheral-membrane protein, opposed to being a transmembrane protein as previously speculated. Thus, ORF6 localization and IFN antagonism are independent activities, which raises the possibility that ORF6 may have additional functions within membrane networks to enhance virus replication."}, {"title": "Omicron: A heavily mutated SARS-CoV-2 variant exhibits stronger binding to ACE2 and potently escape approved COVID-19 therapeutic antibodies", "doi": "10.1101/2021.12.04.471200", "rxiv_url": "http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.04.471200", "rxiv_date": "2021-12-07", "rxiv_site": "biorxiv", "affs": ["Department of Physiology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea", "Department of Biomedical Science, Graduate School, Ajou University, Suwon, Korea"], "journal": null, "journal_doi": null, "journal_date_received": null, "journal_date_accepted": null, "journal_date_published": null, "journal_url": null, "abstract": "The new SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern \"Omicron\" was recently (Nov. 24th. 2021) spotted in South Africa and already spread around the world due to its enhanced transmissibility.

More worrying, Omicron infections have been reported in individuals who have received vaccines jabs in South Africa and Hong Kong. Here, we investigated the binding strength of Omicron with ACE2 and seven monoclonal antibodies that are either approved by FDA for COVID-19 therapy or undergoing phase III clinical trials. Computational mutagenesis and binding free energies could confirm that Omicron Spike binds ACE2 stronger than prototype SARS-CoV-2. Notably, three substitutions, i.e., T478K, Q493K, and Q498R, significantly contribute to the binding energies and doubled electrostatic potential of the RBDOmic-ACE2 complex. Instead of E484K substitution that helped neutralization escape of Beta, Gamma, and Mu variants, Omicron harbors E484A substitution. Together, T478K, Q493K, Q498R, and E484A substitutions contribute to a significant drop in the electrostatic potential energies between RBDOmic-mAbs, particularly in Etesevimab, Bamlanivimab, and CT-p59. CDR diversification could help regain the neutralization strength of these antibodies; however, we could not conduct this analysis to this end. Conclusively, our findings suggest that Omicron binds ACE2 with greater affinity, enhancing its infectivity and transmissibility. Mutations in the Spike are prudently devised by the virus that enhances the receptor binding and weakens the mAbs binding to escape the immune response."}, {"title": "SARS-CoV-2 infection of olfactory epithelial cells and neurons drives acute lung injury and lethal COVID-19 in mice", "doi": "10.1101/2021.12.04.471245", "rxiv_url": "http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.04.471245", "rxiv_date": "2021-12-07", "rxiv_site": "biorxiv", "affs": ["Department of Medicine and Cardiovascular Institute, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Civic Center Blvd, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA", "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA", "Department of Microbiology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America", "Department of Biomedical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA", "Black Family Stem Cell Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA; Department of Cell, Developmental and Regenerative Biology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA", "Penn-CHOP Lung Biology Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA", "Department of Dermatology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA"], "journal": null, "journal_doi": null, "journal_date_received": null, "journal_date_accepted": null, "journal_date_published": null, "journal_url": null, "abstract": "Lethal COVID-19 is associated with respiratory failure that is thought to be caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to pulmonary infection.

To functionally test the cellular mechanisms of COVID-19, we generated hACE2fl animals in which human ACE2 (hACE2) is expressed from the mouse Ace2 locus in a manner that permits cell-specific, Cre-mediated loss of function. hACE2fl animals developed lethal weight loss and hypoxemia within 7 days of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 that was associated with pulmonary infiltrates, intravascular thrombosis and patchy viral infection of lung epithelial cells.

The Q498R, Y505H and G496S mutations, in addition to N501Y, highly increased the binding to hACE2.

radiomics-based model for differentiation of COVID-19 pneumonia from other lung diseases using a very large cohort of patients.\n\nMethodsWe collected 19 private and 5 public datasets, accumulating to 26,307 individual patient images (15,148 COVID-19; 9,657 with other lung diseases e.g. non-COVID-19 pneumonia, lung cancer, pulmonary embolism; 1502 normal cases). Images were automatically segmented using a validated deep learning (DL) model and the results carefully reviewed. Images were first cropped into lung-only region boxes, then resized to 296x216 voxels. Voxel dimensions was resized to 1x1x1mm3 followed by 64-bin discretization. The 108 extracted features included shape, first-order histogram and texture features. Univariate analysis was first performed using simple logistic regression. The thresholds were fixed in the training set and then evaluation performed on the test set. False discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied to the p-values. Z-Score normalization was applied to all features. For multivariate analysis, features with high correlation (R2>0.99) were eliminated first using Pearson correlation. We tested 96 different machine learning strategies through cross-combining 4 feature selectors or 8 dimensionality reduction techniques with 8 classifiers. We trained and evaluated our models using 3 different datasets: 1) the entire dataset (26,307 patients: 15,148 COVID-19; 11,159 non-COVID-19); 2) excluding normal patients in non-COVID-19, and including only RT-PCR positive COVID-19 cases in the COVID-19 class (20,697 patients including 12,419 COVID-19, and 8,278 non-COVID-19)); 3) including only non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients and a random sample of COVID-19 patients (5,582 patients: 3,000 COVID-19, and 2,582 non-COVID-19) to provide balanced classes. Subsequently, each of these 3 datasets were randomly split into 70% and 30% for training and testing, respectively. All various steps, including feature preprocessing, feature selection, and classification, were performed separately in each dataset. Classification algorithms were optimized during training using grid search algorithms. The best models were chosen by a one-standard-deviation rule in 10-fold cross-validation and then were evaluated on the test sets.\n\nResultsIn dataset #1, Relief feature selection and RF classifier combination resulted in the highest performance (Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.99, sensitivity = 0.98, specificity = 0.94, accuracy = 0.96, positive predictive value (PPV) = 0.96, and negative predicted value (NPV) = 0.96). In dataset #2, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) feature selection and Random Forest (RF) classifier combination resulted in the highest performance (AUC = 0.99, sensitivity = 0.98, specificity = 0.95, accuracy = 0.97, PPV = 0.96, and NPV = 0.98). In dataset #3, the ANOVA feature selection and RF classifier combination resulted in the highest performance (AUC = 0.98, sensitivity = 0.96, specificity = 0.93, accuracy = 0.94, PPV = 0.93, NPV = 0.96).\n\nConclusionRadiomic features extracted from entire lung combined with machine learning algorithms can enable very effective, routine diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia from CT images without the use of any other diagnostic test."}, {"title": "Genetic overlap between idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COVID-19", "doi": "10.1101/2021.12.08.21267459", "rxiv_url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.08.21267459", "rxiv_date": "2021-12-08", "rxiv_site": "medrxiv", "affs": ["Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK", "Department of Genetics and Genome Biology, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK", "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK", "National Institute for Health Research, Leicester Respiratory Biomedical Research Centre, Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, UK"], "journal": null, "journal_doi": null, "journal_date_received": null, "journal_date_accepted": null, "journal_date_published": null, "journal_url": null, "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) have identified genetic loci associated with both traits, suggesting possible shared biological mechanisms.

Simulation of clinical trials allows in silico exploration of the uncertainties of clinical trial design and can rapidly inform their protocols. We previously published a preliminary model of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. To further our understanding of COVID-19 and treatment we significantly updated the model by matching a curated dataset spanning viral load and immune responses in plasma and lung. We identified a population of parameter sets to generate heterogeneity in pathophysiology and treatment and tested this model against published reports from interventional SARS-CoV-2 targeting Ab and anti-viral trials. Upon generation and selection of a virtual population, we match both the placebo and treated responses in viral load in these trials. We extended the model to predict the rate of hospitalization or death within a population. Via comparison of the in silico predictions with clinical data, we hypothesize that the immune response to virus is log-linear over a wide range of viral load. To validate this approach, we show the model matches a published subgroup analysis, sorted by baseline viral load, of patients treated with neutralizing Abs. By simulating intervention at different timepoints post infection, the model predicts efficacy is not sensitive to interventions within five days of symptom onset, but efficacy is dramatically reduced if more than five days pass post-symptom onset prior to treatment."}, {"title": "Dynamic analysis and evaluation of asymptomatic infection in the spread of COVID-19", "doi": "10.1101/2021.12.07.21267442", "rxiv_url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.07.21267442", "rxiv_date": "2021-12-08", "rxiv_site": "medrxiv", "affs": ["School of Science, Beijing University of Architecture, 100044, China"], "journal": null, "journal_doi": null, "journal_date_received": null, "journal_date_accepted": null, "journal_date_published": null, "journal_url": null, "abstract": "COVID-19 has spread worldwide for nearly two years. Many countries have experienced repeated epidemics, that is, after the epidemic has been controlled for a period of time, the number of new cases per day is low, and the outbreak will occur again a few months later. In order to study the relationship between this low level of infection and the number of asymptomatic infections, and to evaluate the role of asymptomatic infections in the development of the epidemic, we have established an improved infectious disease dynamics model that can be used to evaluate the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, and fitted the epidemic data in the three flat periods in England. According to the obtained parameters, according to the calculation of the model, the proportion of asymptomatic infections in these three flat periods are 41%, 53% and 58% respectively. After the first flat period, the number of daily newly confirmed cases predicted by the model began to increase around July 1, 2020. After more than four months of epidemic spread, it reached a peak on November 12, which is consistent with the actual case situation. Unanimous. After the second flat period, the model predicts that the number of new confirmed cases per day will increase from about May 7, 2021, and after about 73 days of epidemic development, it will reach a peak on July 20, showing the overall trend of the epidemic. In the above, the predicted results of the model are consistent with the actual cases. After the third flat period, the number of daily newly diagnosed cases predicted by the model began to increase around December 1, 2021, and reached a peak in December, and the number of cases will drop to a very low level after May 2022. According to our research results, due to the large number of asymptomatic infections, the spread of the epidemic is not easy to stop completely in a short time. However, when the epidemic enters a period of flat time, nucleic acid testing is performed, and asymptomatic infections are isolated at home for 14 days (the recovery period of symptomatic infection is about 10 days) may be an option that can be considered to interrupt the transmission of the case."}, {"title": "Mortality trends and lengths of stay among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Ontario and Quebec (Canada): a population-based cohort study of the first three epidemic waves", "doi": "10.1101/2021.12.07.21267416", "rxiv_url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.07.21267416", "rxiv_date": "2021-12-08", "rxiv_site": "medrxiv", "affs": ["Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Population and Global Health, McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada", "MAP Centre for Urban Health Solutions, St. Michael\u2019s Hospital, Unity Health Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada", "D\u00e9partement de m\u00e9decine sociale et pr\u00e9ventive, Facult\u00e9 de m\u00e9decine, Universit\u00e9 Laval, Qu\u00e9bec, QC, Canada", "Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment (THETA) collaborative, University Health Network", "Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation (IHPME), Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto", "Public Health Ontario, Toronto, ON, Canada", "ICES, Toronto, ON, Canada", "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada", "Centre for Outcomes Research and Evaluation (CORE), Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada", "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases and Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada", "Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Toronto"], "journal": null, "journal_doi": null, "journal_date_received": null, "journal_date_accepted": null, "journal_date_published": null, "journal_url": null, "abstract": "BackgroundEpidemic waves of COVID-19 strained hospital resources. We describe temporal trends in mortality risk and length of stay in intensive cares units (ICUs) among COVID-19 patients hospitalized through the first three epidemic waves in Canada.\n\nMethodsWe used population-based provincial hospitalization data from Ontario and Quebec to examine mortality risk and lengths of ICU stay. For each province, adjusted estimates were obtained using marginal standardization of logistic regression models, adjusting for patient-level characteristics and hospital-level determinants.\n\nResultsUsing all hospitalizations from Ontario (N=26,541) and Quebec (N=23,857), we found that unadjusted in-hospital mortality risks peaked at 31% in the first wave and was lowest at the end of the third wave at 6-7%. This general trend remained after controlling for confounders. The odds of in-hospital mortality in the highest hospital occupancy quintile was 1.2 (95%CI: 1.0-1.4; Ontario) and 1.6 (95%CI: 1.3-1.9; Quebec) times that of the lowest quintile. Variants of concerns were associated with an increased in-hospital mortality. Length of ICU stay decreased over time from a mean of 16 days (SD=18) to 15 days (SD=15) in the third wave but were consistently higher in Ontario than Quebec by 3-6 days.\n\nConclusionIn-hospital mortality risks and lengths of ICU stay declined over time in both provinces, despite changing patient demographics, suggesting that new therapeutics and treatment, as well as improved clinical protocols, could have contributed to this reduction.

We fit our model to reports for several jurisdictions in the US and Canada, providing estimates of mean and dispersion for cluster size, whilst factoring in imperfect ascertainment. Our parameter estimates are robust to variations in ascertainment fraction. We use these estimates in three ways: i) to explore how uneven the distribution of cases is among different clusters in different jurisdictions (that is, what fraction of cases are in the 20% largest clusters), ii) to estimate how long it will be until we see a cluster a given size in jurisdiction, and iii) to determine the distribution of instantaneous transmission rate {beta} among different index case.

Among participants who were undertaking antibody tests and self-reporting PCR and lateral flow tests taken through the national testing programme, we identified those who were thought to be infected outside the household during the second wave of the pandemic. We used exposure data on attending work, using public or shared transport, using shops and other non-household activities taken from monthly surveys during the second wave of the pandemic. We used multivariable logistic regression models to assess the relative independent contribution of these exposures on risk of acquiring infection outside the household. We calculated Adjusted Population Attributable Fractions (APAF - the proportion of non-household transmission in the cohort thought to be attributable to each exposure) based on odds ratios and frequency of exposure in cases.\n\nResultsBased on analysis of 10475 adult participants including 874 infections acquired outside the household, infection was independently associated with: leaving home for work (AOR 1.20 (1.02 - 1.42) p=0.0307, APAF 6.9%); public transport use (AOR for use more than once per week 1.82 (1.49 - 2.23) p<0.0001, APAF for public transport 12.42%); and shopping (AOR for shopping more than once per week 1.69 (1.29 - 2.21) P=0.0003, APAF for shopping 34.56%). Other non-household activities such as use of hospitality and leisure venues were rare due to restrictions and there were no significant associations with infection risk.\n\nConclusionsA high proportion of the second wave of the pandemic was spent under conditions where people were being advised to work from home where possible, and to minimize exposure to shops, and a wide range of other businesses were subject to severe restrictions. Vaccines were being rolled out to high-risk groups. During this time, going to work was an important risk factor for infection but public transport use likely accounted for a lot of this risk. Only a minority of the cohort left home for work or used public or shared transport. By contrast, the majority of participants visited shops and this activity accounted for about one-third of non-household transmission."}, {"title": "Survival and outcomes of tocilizumab use in severe and critically ill Covid-19 patients not responding to steroids", "doi": "10.1101/2021.12.06.21266950", "rxiv_url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.06.21266950", "rxiv_date": "2021-12-08", "rxiv_site": "medrxiv", "affs": ["*Max Super Specialty Hospital, Mohali, Punjab, India", "^Dr. Harvansh Singh Judge Institute of Dental Sciences & Hospital, Chandigarh,India"], "journal": null, "journal_doi": null, "journal_date_received": null, "journal_date_accepted": null, "journal_date_published": null, "journal_url": null, "abstract": "BackgroundMortality and morbidity are highest in severe and critically ill patients with COVID -19 pneumonia. Recently corticosteroids have shown a definite mortality benefit in these patients. In this study we used interleukin -6 inhibitor, tocilizumab in patients who failed to show any clinical improvement after initial treatment with steroids.\n\nPatients and methodsThis is a retrospective observational study conducted at a tertiary care referral hospital in India. Severe and critical COVID 19 patients, who got admitted to intensive care unit and subsequently received tocilizumab were included. Patients who worsened clinically or had no change in oxygen requirement even after 24hrs of receiving Intravenous methylprednisolone at a dose of 1-2mg/kg/day received a maximum total dose of 800mg of intravenous tocilizumab. The day 28 all cause mortality and progression to mechanical ventilation were the primary outcome measures. Clinical improvement and oxygen requirements after tocilizumab administration along with trends in inflammatory markers were secondary outcome. Secondary infections rates and other drug related side effects were also noted.\n\nResultsA total of 51 patients who did not show clinical improvement even after 24 hours of intravenous steroids and received tocilizumab were included. In these patients, there was a significant decrease in oxygen requirement by day 3 and clinical improvement by day 7 of tocilizumab administration. Among the inflammatory markers, we observed elevated median baseline values of CRP (114.2 mg/L), IL-6 (55.4 pg/ml) and Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (12.4). Out of these only CRP showed a significant decrease after the drug administration. 13 (26.5%) of the 49 patients who were on non-invasive or conventional oxygen support progressed to mechanical ventilation. The day 28 all-cause mortality rate was 10/51(19.6%). 10(19.6%) of the 51 patients had life threatening infections, 5/51 had thrombocytopenia, 3/51 had pneumo-mediastenum/pneumothorax, 1 patient had colonic perforation and 1 patient had transaminitis following tocilizumab administration.\n\nConclusionEarly and timely administration of tocilizumab only in selected severe and critical covid patients not responding to initial steroids appears to increase the survival.

Postvaccination antibodies are robustly produced by those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) even on immune-modifying therapies but are blunted by anti-TNF therapy. In contrast, T-cell response which primarily determines long-term efficacy against disease progression,, is less well understood. We aimed to assess the post-vaccination T-cell response and its relationship to antibody responses in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on immune-modifying therapies.\n\nMethodsWe evaluated IBD patients who completed SARS-CoV-2 vaccination using samples collected at four time points (dose 1, dose 2, 2 weeks after dose 2, 8 weeks after dose 2). T-cell clonal analysis was performed by T-cell Receptor (TCR) immunosequencing. The breadth (number of unique sequences to a given protein) and depth (relative abundance of all the unique sequences to a given protein) of the T-cell clonal response were quantified using reference datasets and were compared to antibody responses.\n\nResultsOverall, 303 subjects were included (55% female; 5% with prior COVID) (Table). 53% received BNT262b (Pfizer), 42% mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and 5% Ad26CoV2 (J&J). The Spike-specific clonal response peaked 2 weeks after completion of the vaccine regimen (3- and 5-fold for breadth and depth, respectively); no changes were seen for non-Spike clones, suggesting vaccine specificity. Reduced T-cell clonal depth was associated with chronologic age, male sex, and immunomodulator treatment. It was preserved by non-anti-TNF biologic therapies, and augmented clonal depth was associated with anti-TNF treatment. TCR depth and breadth were associated with vaccine type; after adjusting for age and gender, Ad26CoV2 (J&J) exhibited weaker metrics than mRNA-1273 (Moderna) (p=0.01 for each) or BNT262b (Pfizer) (p=0.056 for depth). Antibody and T-cell responses were only modestly correlated. While those with robust humoral responses also had robust TCR clonal expansion, a substantial fraction of patients with high antibody levels had only a minimal T-cell clonal response.\n\nConclusionAge, sex and select immunotherapies are associated with the T-cell clonal response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and T-cell responses are low in many patients despite high antibody levels. These factors, as well as differences seen by vaccine type may help guide reimmunization vaccine strategy in immune-impaired populations.

During the first wave (symptomatic), the interwave period, and the second wave (symptomatic and asymptomatic), participants were diagnosed using nasopharyngeal swabs taken in kiosks. Symptomatic individuals with risk factors for serious disease or death were referred to hospital. SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined by real time polymerase chain reaction in all hospitalized patients. All data from hospitalized patients and outpatients were added to the SISVER database.\n\nResultsThe total cohort size for this study was 2,260,156 persons (having a mean age of 43.1 years). Of these, 8.6% suffered from DM, 11.6% from hypertension, and 9.7% from obesity. Of the total of 2,260,156 persons, 666,694 tested positive (29.5%) to SARS CoV-2, (with a mean age of 45). During the first wave, 82,489 tested positive; in the interwave period, 112,115; and during the second wave, 472,090. That is, a considerable increase in the number of cases of infection was observed in all age groups between the first and second waves (an increase of +472% on the first wave).\n\nOf the infected persons, a total of 85,587 (12.8%) were hospitalized: 24,023 in the first wave (29.1% of those who tested positive in this period); 16,935 (15.1%) during the interwave period, and 44,629 (9.5%) in the second wave, which represents an increase of 85.77% on the first wave.\n\nOf the hospitalized patients, there were 42,979 deaths (50.2% of those hospitalized), in the first wave, 11,964 (49.8% of those hospitalized in this period), during the interwave period, 6,794 (40.1%), and in the second wave 24,221 (54.3%), an increase of +102.4% between the first wave and the second.\n\nWhile within the general population, the probability of a patient dying having both COVID-19 and one of the specified comorbidities (DM, obesity, or arterial hypertension) showed a systematic reduction across all age groups, the probability of death for a hospitalized patient with comorbidities increased across all age groups during the second wave. When comparing the fatality rate of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the second wave with those of the first wave and the interwave period, a significant increase was observed across all age groups, even in individuals without comorbidities.\n\nConclusionThe data from this study show a considerable increase in the number of detected cases of infection in all age groups between the first and second waves. In addition, 12.8% of those infected were hospitalized for severe COVID-19, representing an increase of +85.9% from the first wave to the second.

Vulnerable populations include older individuals with presumed weakening of the immune response. Identification of factors influencing COVID-19 infection could provide an additional means for protecting such individuals.\n\nMethodsMembers of a family study previously interviewed as middle aged individuals were re-contacted and asked to participate in extended phone interview (2-3 hours) covering past and current mental health issues, physical health diagnoses, use of alcohol and drugs, and exposure to anyone with COVID-19. The average follow-up period was 32 years. Detailed medication use was collected to confirm medical diagnoses and to reveal possible protective effects of particular drug classes currently prescribed for the participant by their physician. Serology was available for red cell antigens (ABO, Kell, Duffy, Kidd, Rhesus) and HLA subtypes. Analyses were conducted to contrast COVID-19 + and COVID-19 - individuals for physical and mental health diagnoses, use of alcohol and drugs, and red cell and HLA serology. Additionally, analyses were conducted to contrast these groups with a group reporting known exposure but absence of COVID-19 symptoms or diagnosis by a health professional.\n\nResultsInterviews were completed between September 2020 and November 2021. A total of 42 of the 90 individuals interviewed had been vaccinated at the time of interview. At the time of interview, 11.1% reported having developed COVID-19.\n\nUsing quantity per occasion (QPO) and quantity by frequency (QXF) totals in the past month by type of alcohol consumed, we found a significant association between QPO for liquor (p=0.017) and marginal effects for QXF for liquor consumption (p=0.06). Exposed individuals who were COVID-19 negative tended to drink more liquor than those who were positive, an average of about one drink per day. Beer and wine consumption were not statistically significant. A diagnosis of alcohol use disorder at baseline evaluation was not a significant predictor of being COVID positive or negative.\n\nSelf-reported current depression or depression in the past only was not a predictor of COVID-19 status based on a single question \"Are you depressed currently or only in the past?\". In contrast, completion of a clinical interview designed to elicit depressed mood and concurrent symptoms for determination of the lifetime presence or absence of a depressive episode did reveal a significant effect. Comparison of responses at baseline to follow-up showed those most resilient to developing COVID-19 were those without evidence of a depressive episode by lifetime history at both points in time.\n\nPhysical health issues were analyzed for those that were frequently occurring in our sample such as hypertension but not found to be significant. BMI was analyzed and found to be statistically non-significant.\n\nAnalysis of HLA variation across the whole sample did not reveal a significant association but among males two variants, A1 and B8, did show significant variation associated with COVID-19+ and COVID-19-status. Analyses of the red cell antigens revealed one significant red cell effect; Kidd genotypic variation was associated with COVID-19 status.\n\nInterpretationWe tentatively conclude that use of specific types of alcohol, namely liquor, is associated with reduced frequency of COVID-19. However, the amount is low, averaging about 1 drink per day. Enlarged samples are needed to confirm these results. The finding that past history of alcohol use disorder does not increase likelihood of developing COVID-19 is important. It should be noted that the 34 individuals diagnosed with AUD at baseline had survived an average of 32 years in order to participate in the current interview suggesting they may be especially resilient to adverse health conditions. The finding that a single question designed to elicit the presence or absence of depressed mood either currently or in the past was not a risk factor for COVID-19 in contrast to report of a clinically significant past history of a depressive episode based on more extensive examination using DSM criteria is important.

However, current triaging methods often have poor predictive performance, are based on variables that are expensive to measure, and lead to decisions that are sometimes hard to interpret.\n\nOBJECTIVEWe introduce two new classification methods that are able to predict COVID-19 mortality risk from the automatic analysis of routine clinical variables with high accuracy and interpretability. The classifiers, denominated SVM22-GASS and Clinical-GASS, leverage machine learning methods and clinical expertise, respectively.\n\nMETHODSBoth classifiers were developed using a derivation cohort of 499 patients and were validated with an independent validation cohort of 250 patients. The cohorts included COVID-19 positive patients admitted to two hospitals in the Italian Province of Ferrara between March 2020 and June 2020 (derivation cohort) and between September 2020 and March 2021 (validation cohort). The potential predictive variables analyzed in this study included demographic, anamnestic, and laboratory data, retrieved with the patients consents from their electronic health records.\n\nThe SVM22-GASS classifier is based on a Support Vector Machine model (SVM) with Radial Basis Function kernel (RBF). Importantly, the model uses only a subset of predictive variables that were automatically selected with the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), while the RBF kernel is approximated with random feature expansions to reduce the computational requirements. The Clinical-GASS classifier is a threshold-based classifier that leverages the General Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Severity (GASS) score: a highly interpretable COVID-19-specific clinical score that has been recently shown to be more effective at predicting the COVID-19 mortality risk than standard clinical scores.\n\nRESULTSThe SVM22-GASS model was able to predict the mortality risk of the validation cohort with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.87 and an accuracy of 0.88 -- performing on par with influential classification methods that exploit variables derived from expensive analyses such as medical imaging. Furthermore, variable importance analyses showed that the model relies primarily on eight variables for its predictions: White Blood Cell Count, Lymphocyte Count, Brain Natriuretic Peptide, Creatine Phosphokinase, Lactate Dehydrogenase, Fibrinogen, PaO2/FiO2 Ratio, and High-Sensitivity Troponin I.\n\nSimilarly, the Clinical-GASS classifier predicted the mortality risk of the validation cohort with an AUC of 0.77 and an accuracy of 0.78 -- on par with other established and emerging machine-learning-based methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONSOur results demonstrate that it is possible to accurately predict the COVID-19 mortality risk using only routine clinical variables that can be readily collected in the very early stages of hospital admission. The classifiers have the potential to assist the clinicians in quickly identifying the patients mortality risk to optimally allocate both human and financial resources."}, {"title": "Clinical Evaluation of a Combo Rapid Antigen Test QuickNavi-Flu+COVID19 Ag for Simultaneous Detection of SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza Viruses", "doi": "10.1101/2021.12.05.21267215", "rxiv_url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.05.21267215", "rxiv_date": "2021-12-08", "rxiv_site": "medrxiv", "affs": ["aDepartment of Infectious Diseases, University of Tsukuba Hospital, 2-1-1 Amakubo, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8576, Japan", "bDivision of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Tsukuba Medical Center Hospital, 1-3-1 Amakubo Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8558, Japan", "cDepartment of Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan", "dAkashi Internal Medicine Clinic, 3-1-63 Asahigaoka, Kashiwara, Osaka 582-0026, Japan", "eDenka Co., Ltd.

They also have been shown to be safe and effective in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on biologic therapies. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of vaccination among patients with IBD on biologic therapies.\n\nMethodsA single-center prospective cross-sectional study conducted at a tertiary care inflammatory bowel disease center. Data from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who attended the gastroenterology infusion clinic from June 1st, 2021 until October 31st, 2021 were retrieved. Patients received infliximab or vedolizumab at least 6 weeks before recruitment were included. The primary outcome was prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination. The secondary outcome was to assess whether prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination differed based sex, age, type of biologic therapy and citizenship status.\n\nResultsThe total number of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients enrolled in the study was 280 (56.0% male and 44.0% female). The median age was 33.2 years and BMI was 24.8 kg/m2. 112 patients with ulcerative colitis (40.0%) and 168 (60.0%) with Crohns disease. 117 (41.8%) were vaccinated with either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 163 (58.2%) were not vaccinated. Female patients were more likely to receive the vaccine compared to male patients (83.0% vs. 63.8%, p < 0.001). In addition, older patients (above the age 50) were also more likely to receive the vaccine than younger patients, below the age of 50 (95.6% vs 31.2% p< 0.001). Expatriates were more likely to receive the vaccine than citizens (84.8% vs 25.0%, p < 0.001). There was no statistical difference between patients on Infliximab and vedolizumab in terms of prevalence of vaccination (40.0% vs 48.0%, p= 0.34).\n\nConclusionThe overall prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on biologic therapies was lower than the general population and world health organization (WHO) recommendation. Female patients, patients above the age of 50, and expatriates were more likely to be vaccinated. On the other hand, male patients, patients below the age of 50, and citizens were less likely to be vaccinated."}, {"title": "The influence of new SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron (B.1.1.529) on vaccine efficacy, its correlation to Delta Variants: a computational approach", "doi": "10.1101/2021.12.06.471215", "rxiv_url": "http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.06.471215", "rxiv_date": "2021-12-08", "rxiv_site": "biorxiv", "affs": ["Centre for Genetic Disorders, Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University,Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India", "PSG College of Pharmacy, Coimbatore, Tamilnadu, India"], "journal": null, "journal_doi": null, "journal_date_received": null, "journal_date_accepted": null, "journal_date_published": null, "journal_url": null, "abstract": "The newly discovered COVID variant B.1.1.529 in Botswana has more than 30 mutations in spike and many other in non-spike proteins, far more than any other SARS-CoV-2 variant accepted as a variant of concern by the WHO and officially named Omicron, and has sparked concern among scientists and the general public.

Computational analysis revealed that the Omicron variant has a higher binding affinity for the human ACE2 receptor than the wild and Delta (AY.1 and AY.2 strains), but lower than the Delta AY.3 strain. MD simulation and docking analysis suggest that the omicron and Delta AY.3 were found to have relatively unstable and compact RBD structures and hampered interactions with antibodies more than wild and Delta (AY.1 and AY.2), which may lead to relatively more pathogenicity and antibody escape.

Our analyses suggest that as compared to previous variants of concern, the Omicron variant has increased antibody escape breadth due to mutations in class 3 and 4 antibody epitopes as well as increased escape depth due to accumulated mutations in class 1 antibody epitopes. We note certain RBD mutations that might further enhance Omicron escape, and in particular advise careful surveillance of two subclades bearing R346S/K mutations. Further, AAI network analysis suggests that the function of certain therapeutic monoclonal antibodies may be disrupted by Omicron mutations as a result of the cumulative indirect perturbations to the epitope surface properties, despite point-mutation analyses suggesting these antibodies are tolerant of the set of Omicron mutations in isolation.

Hypoxia, a hallmark of COVID-19 ARDS, was found to elicit a global metabolic reprogramming in effector lymphocytes.

While all five antibodies bound conformational-specific epitopes within SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein, only PD5, PD7, and SC23 were able to bind to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD). Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to examine the S protein RBD in cells infected with the Singapore isolates SARS-CoV-2/0334 and SARS-CoV-2/1302. The RBD-binders exhibited a distinct cytoplasmic staining pattern that was primarily localised within the Golgi complex and was distinct from the diffuse cytoplasmic staining pattern exhibited by the non-RBD binders (PD4 and SC29). These data indicated that the S protein adopted a conformation in the Golgi complex that enabled the RBD recognition by the RBD-binders. The RBD-binders also recognised the uncleaved S protein indicating that S protein cleavage was not required for RBD recognition. Electron microscopy indicated high levels of cell-associated virus particles, and multiple cycle virus infection using RBD-binder staining provided evidence for direct cell-to-cell transmission for both isolates. Although similar levels of RBD-binder staining was demonstrated for each isolate, the SARS-CoV-2/1302 exhibited slower rates of cell-to-cell transmission. These data suggest that a conformational change in the S protein occurs during its transit through the Golgi complex that enables RBD recognition by the RBD-binders, and suggests that these antibodies can be used to monitor S protein RBD formation during the early stages of infection.\n\nImportanceThe SARS CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) mediates the attachment of SARS CoV-2 to the host cell. This interaction plays an essential role in initiating virus infection and the S protein RBD is therefore a focus of therapeutic and vaccine interventions. However, new virus variants have emerged with altered biological properties in the RBD that can potentially negate these interventions. Therefore an improved understanding of the biological properties of the RBD in virus-infected cells may offer future therapeutic strategies to mitigate SARS CoV-2 infection. We used physiologically relevant antibodies that were isolated from the B cells of convalescent COVID19 patients to monitor the RBD in cells infected with SARS CoV-2 clinical isolates. These immunological reagents specifically recognise the correctly folded RBD and were used to monitor the appearance of the RBD in SARS CoV-2-infected cells and identified the site where the RBD first appears."}, {"title": "Characterization of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Membrane Protein and Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) as a Potential Therapeutic Target", "doi": "10.1101/2021.12.06.471464", "rxiv_url": "http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.06.471464", "rxiv_date": "2021-12-08", "rxiv_site": "biorxiv", "affs": ["Multidisciplinary Laboratory of Food and Health, School of Applied Sciences, State University of Campinas, Limeira, SP 13484-350, Brazil", "Laboratory of Signaling Mechanisms, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, State University of Campinas, Campinas, SP 13083-871, Brazil", "Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil", "Laboratory of Emerging Virus, Department of Genetics, Evolution, Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Biology, University of Campinas, SP 13083-862, Brazil", "S\u00e3o Paulo University Medical School, Department of Pathology, S\u00e3o Paulo University", "Institute of Biology, State University of Campinas, Campinas, SP 13083-871, Brazil", "Experimental Medicine Research Cluster, State University of Campinas, SP 13083-862, Brazil"], "journal": null, "journal_doi": null, "journal_date_received": null, "journal_date_accepted": null, "journal_date_published": null, "journal_url": null, "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging virus from the Coronaviridae family and is responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

We validated the M PCNA interaction through immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence co-localization, and a PLA assay.

After this validation of our computational approach, we identified potential hot spot residues in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the presence of COVOX-222 and S2H97 antibodies. We identified sites in the antigen-antibody interface with strong dampening of fluctuation that may indicate potential antibody escape due to single mutations. Many of these sites were found to match known sites of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. The determination of single sites with large effect on antigen-antibody binding interfaces is crucial to discriminating neutral variants from potential escape variants. In summary, we provide a cheap, fast, and accurate in silico method to identify and quantify potential hot spots of functional evolution in antibody binding footprints."}, {"title": "Opening up safely: public health system requirements for ongoing COVID-19 management based on evaluation of Australia's surveillance system performance", "doi": "10.1101/2021.12.06.21266926", "rxiv_url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.06.21266926", "rxiv_date": "2021-12-09", "rxiv_site": "medrxiv", "affs": ["National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia", "School of Public Health, University of Adelaide, Australia", "Department of Health, Victoria, Australia"], "journal": null, "journal_doi": null, "journal_date_received": null, "journal_date_accepted": null, "journal_date_published": null, "journal_url": null, "abstract": "BackgroundOngoing management of COVID-19 requires an evidence-based understanding of the performance of public health measures to date, and application of this evidence to evolving response objectives. This paper aims to define system requirements for COVID-19 management under future transmission and response scenarios, based on surveillance system performance to date.\n\nMethodsFrom 1st November 2020 to 30th June 2021 community transmission was eliminated in Australia, allowing investigation of system performance in detecting novel outbreaks, including against variants of concern (VoCs). We characterised surveillance systems in place from peer-reviewed and publicly available data, analysed the epidemiological characteristics of novel outbreaks over this period, and assessed surveillance system sensitivity and timeliness in outbreak detection. These findings were integrated with analysis of other critical COVID-19 public health measures to establish requirements for future COVID-19 management.\n\nFindingsAustralia reported 25 epidemiologically distinct outbreaks and 5 distinct clusters of cases in the study period, all linked through genomic sequencing to breaches in quarantine facilities housing international travellers. Most (21/30, 70%) were detected through testing of those with acute respiratory illness in the community, and 9 through quarantine screening. For the 21 detected in the community, the testing rate (percent of the total State population tested in the week preceding detection) was 2.07% on average, was higher for those detected while prior outbreaks were ongoing. For 17/30 with data, the delay from the primary case to detection of the index case was, on average 4.9 days, with 10 of the 17 outbreaks detected within 5 days and 3 detected after > 7days. One outbreak was preceded by an unexpected positive wastewater detection. Of the 24 outbreaks in 2021, 20 had publicly available sequencing data, all of which were VoCs. Surveillance for future VoCs using a similar strategy to that used for detecting SARS-CoV-2 to date would necessitate a 100-1,000-fold increase in capacity for genomic sequencing.\n\nInterpretationAustralias surveillance systems performed well in detecting novel introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in a period when community transmission was eliminated, introductions were infrequent and case numbers were low. Detection relied on community surveillance in symptomatic members of the general population and quarantine screening, supported by comprehensive genomic sequencing. Once vaccine coverage is maximised, the priority for future COVID-19 control will shift to detection of SARS-CoV-2 Vos associated with increased severity of disease in the vaccinated and vaccine ineligible. This will require ongoing investment in maintaining surveillance systems and testing of all international arrivals, alongside greatly increased genomic sequencing capacity. Other essential requirements for managing voices are maintaining outbreak response capacity and developing capacity to rapidly engineer, manufacture, and distribute variant vaccines at scale. The most important factor in management of COVID-19 now and into the future will continue to be how effectively governments support all sectors of the community to engage in control measures."}, {"title": "Safety and Immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 S-2P Protein Vaccine MVC-COV1901 in People Living with HIV", "doi": "10.1101/2021.12.08.21267439", "rxiv_url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.08.21267439", "rxiv_date": "2021-12-09", "rxiv_site": "medrxiv", "affs": ["aDepartment of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan", "bSchool of Public Health, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan", "cMedigen Vaccine Biologics, Taipei, Taiwan", "dInstitute of Public Health, College of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan", "eDepartment of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan", "fCollege of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan", "gSchool of Public Health, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan", "hDepartment of Medicine, National Taiwan University Cancer Center, Taipei, Taiwan", "iDepartment of Internal Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan", "jDepartment of Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan", "kDepartment of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan", "lSchool of Medicine, Graduate Institute of Medicine, Sepsis Research Centre, Centre of Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan", "mDepartment of Infectious Diseases, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan", "nCollege of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan", "oDepartment of Family Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital", "pSchool of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan", "qTri-Service General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan", "rClinical Research Centre, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan", "sSchool of Dental Technology, College of Oral Medicine", "tDepartment of Internal Medicine, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan", "uProgram in Medical Biotechnology, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan", "vDepartment of Paediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan", "wDivision of Infectious Disease, Department of Internal Medicine, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan", "xDepartment of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"], "journal": null, "journal_doi": null, "journal_date_received": null, "journal_date_accepted": null, "journal_date_published": null, "journal_url": null, "abstract": "ObjectivesTo provide data on the immune response to COVID-19 vaccines in people living with HIV (PWH), MVC-COV1901, a recombinant protein vaccine containing S-2P protein adjuvanted with CpG 1018 and aluminium hydroxide, was assessed.\n\nMethodsA total of 57 PWH of [&ge;] 20 years of age who are on stable antiretroviral therapy and with CD4+ T cell [&ge;] 350 cells/mm3 and HIV viral load < 103 copies/ml were compared with 882 HIV-negative participants.

Recent data suggest that persistent SARS-CoV-2 spike antigenemia may contribute to multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). We quantified SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) antigens in blood of pediatric patients with either acute COVID-19 or MIS-C using ultrasensitive immunoassays (Meso Scale Discovery).\n\nMethodsPlasma was collected from inpatients (<21 years) enrolled across 15 hospitals in 15 US states. Acute COVID-19 patients (n=36) had a range of disease severity and positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR within 24 hours of blood collection. Patients with MIS-C (n=53) met CDC criteria and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (RT-PCR or serology).

Vaccine hesitancy is common in the population and in HCWs, and like COVID-19 itself, hesitancy is more frequent in ethnic minority groups. UK-REACH (United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity and COVID-19 outcomes) is a large-scale study of COVID-19 in UK HCWs from diverse ethnic backgrounds, which includes measures of vaccine hesitancy. The present study explores predictors of vaccine hesitancy using a  phenomic approach, considering several hundred questionnaire-based measures.\n\nMethodsUK-REACH includes a questionnaire study encompassing 12,431 HCWs who were recruited from December 2020 to March 2021 and completed a lengthy online questionnaire (785 raw items; 392 derived measures; 260 final measures). Ethnicity was classified using the Office for National Statistics five (ONS5) and eighteen (ONS18) categories. Missing data were handled by multiple imputation. Variable selection used the islasso package in R, which provides standard errors so that results from imputations could be combined using Rubins rules. The data were modelled using path analysis, so that predictors, and predictors of predictors could be assessed. Significance testing used the Bayesian approach of Kass and Raftery, a  very strong Bayes Factor of 150, N=12,431, and a Bonferroni correction giving a criterion of p<4.02 x 10-8 for the main regression, and p<3.11 x 10-10 for variables in the path analysis.\n\nResultsAt the first step of the phenomic analysis, six variables were direct predictors of greater vaccine hesitancy: Lower pro-vaccination attitudes; no flu vaccination in 2019-20; pregnancy; higher COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs; younger age; and lower optimism the roll-out of population vaccination. Overall 44 lower variables in total were direct or indirect predictors of hesitancy, with the remaining 215 variables in the phenomic analysis not independently predicting vaccine hesitancy. Key variables for predicting hesitancy were belief in conspiracy theories of COVID-19 infection, and a low belief in vaccines in general. Conspiracy beliefs had two main sets of influences:\n\nO_LIHigher Fatalism, which was influenced a) by high external and chance locus of control and higher need for closure, which in turn were associated with neuroticism, conscientiousness, extraversion and agreeableness; and b) by religion being important in everyday life, and being Muslim.\nC_LIO_LIreceiving information via social media, not having higher education, and perceiving greater risks to self, the latter being influenced by higher concerns about spreading COVID, greater exposure to COVID-19, and financial concerns.\nC_LI\n\nThere were indirect effects of ethnicity, mediated by religion. Religion was more important for Pakistani and African HCWs, and less important for White and Chinese groups. Lower age had a direct effect on hesitancy, and age and female sex also had several indirect effects on hesitancy.\n\nConclusionsThe phenomic approach, coupled with a path analysis revealed a complex network of social, cognitive, and behavioural influences on SARS-Cov-2 vaccine hesitancy from 44 measures, 6 direct and 38 indirect, with the remaining 215 measures not having direct or indirect effects on hesitancy. It is likely that issues of trust underpin many associations with hesitancy. Understanding such a network of influences may help in tailoring interventions to address vaccine concerns and facilitate uptake in more hesistant groups.\n\nFundingUKMRI-MRC and NIHR"}, {"title": "A descriptive analysis of 2020 California Occupational Safety and Health Administration COVID-19-related complaints", "doi": "10.1101/2021.12.06.21262384", "rxiv_url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.06.21262384", "rxiv_date": "2021-12-09", "rxiv_site": "medrxiv", "affs": ["University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA", "University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, San Francisco, CA, 94110, USA", "University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine, Center for Health and Community, San Francisco, CA, 94143, USA", "Johns Hopkins University, Departments of Biology and of Public Health Studies, Baltimore, MD, 21218, USA", "University of California, San Francisco, Institute for Global Health Sciences, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA"], "journal": null, "journal_doi": null, "journal_date_received": null, "journal_date_accepted": null, "journal_date_published": null, "journal_url": null, "abstract": "COVID-19 mortality disproportionately affected specific occupations and industries.

To assess whether workers in occupations with high COVID-19-related mortality were also most likely to file Cal/OSHA complaints, we compared industry-specific per-capita COVID-19 confirmed deaths from the California Department of Public Health with COVID-19-related complaints. Although 7,820 COVID-19-related complaints were deemed valid by Cal/OSHA, only 627 onsite inspections occurred and 32 citations were issued.

We compare the effectiveness of these countermeasures in reducing transmission including required masking at three levels of mask effectiveness, improving room airflow exchange rates, weekly testing of the students, and lunch partitioning. Our results show that multiple layers of interventions are necessary to keep in-class infections relatively low. These results can inform school administrators about how these interventions can help manage COVID-19 spread within their own elementary school populations."}, {"title": "Access to healthcare as an important moderating variable for understanding geography of immunity levels for COVID-19 - preliminary insights from Poland", "doi": "10.1101/2021.12.08.21267167", "rxiv_url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.08.21267167", "rxiv_date": "2021-12-09", "rxiv_site": "medrxiv", "affs": ["Institute for Veterinary Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Germany", "Interdisciplinary Research Institute, Wroclaw, Poland", "Aidmed, Gda\u0144sk, Poland"], "journal": null, "journal_doi": null, "journal_date_received": null, "journal_date_accepted": null, "journal_date_published": null, "journal_url": null, "abstract": "BackgroundUnderascertainment of COVID-19 burden and uncertainty in estimation of immunity levels is a known and common phenomenon in infectious diseases.

Vital mutations in the VOC are found in spike protein, particularly in the receptor binding domain (RBD), which directly interacts with ACE2 on the host cell membrane, a key determinant of the binding affinity and cell entry. With the reporting of the most recent VOC, omicron, we performed amino acid sequence alignment of the omicron spike protein with that of the wild type and other VOCs. Although it shares several conserved mutations with other variants, we found that omicron has a large number of unique mutations. We applied the Hopp-Woods scale to calculate the hydrophilicity scores of the amino acid stretches of the RBD and the entire spike protein, and found 3 new hydrophilic regions in the RBD of omicron, implying exposure to water, with the potential to bind proteins such as ACE2 increasing transmissibility and infectivity. However, careful analysis reveals that most of the exposed domains of spike protein can serve as antigenic epitopes for generating B cell and T cell-mediated immune responses. This suggests that in the collection of polyclonal antibodies to various epitopes generated after multiple doses of vaccination, some can likely still bind to the omicron spike protein and the RBD to prevent severe clinical disease. In summary, while the omicron variant might result in more infectivity, it can still bind to a reasonable repertoire of antibodies generated by multiple doses of current vaccines likely preventing severe disease. Effective vaccines may not universally prevent opportunistic infections but can prevent the sequelae of severe disease, as observed for the delta variant.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from PCR-confirmed, recovered COVID-19 convalescent patients (n=30) infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States collected in April and May 2020 who possessed at least one or more of six different HLA haplotypes were selected for examination of their anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T-cell responses using a multiplexed peptide-MHC tetramer staining approach. This analysis examined if the previously identified viral epitopes targeted by CD8+ T-cells in these individuals (n=52 distinct epitopes) are mutated in the newly described Omicron VOC (n=50 mutations). Within this population, only one low-prevalence epitope from the Spike protein restricted to two HLA alleles and found in 2/30 (7%) individuals contained a single amino acid change associated with the Omicron VOC. These data suggest that virtually all individuals with existing anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T-cell responses should recognize the Omicron VOC, and that SARS-CoV-2 has not evolved extensive T-cell escape mutations at this time.\n\nImportanceThe newly identified Omicron variant of concern contains more mutations than any of the previous variants described to date. In addition, many of the mutations associated with the Omicron variant are found in areas that are likely bound by neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that the first line of immunological defense against COVID-19 may be compromised. However, both natural infection and vaccination develop T-cell based responses, in addition to antibodies. This study examined if the parts of the virus, or epitopes, targeted by the CD8+ T-cell response in thirty individuals who recovered from COVID-19 in 2020 were mutated in the Omicron variant. Only one of 52 epitopes identified in this population contained an amino acid that was mutated in Omicron.

We used an early passage of isolated and sequence confirmed live Omicron virus isolated in South Africa. We used a human lung cell line clone (H1299-ACE2) engineered to express the ACE2 receptor (2) to both isolate the virus and test neutralization. We also tested growth in the parental H1299 which do not overexpress ACE2 and are not appreciably infectable with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig S1).

Based on the results, NAbs could be unsupervised clustered into six epitope groups (A-F), which is highly concordant with knowledge-based structural classifications.

Furthermore, B.1.1.529 pseudovirus neutralization and RBD binding assay showed that single mutation tolerating NAbs could also be escaped due to multiple synergetic mutations on their epitopes.

Conversely, in binding mAb, it has become less efficient (Center of mass distance of RBD from mAb complex, wildtype-RBD =30 A, Omicron-RBD= 41 A).

Here we develop an analytical framework to investigate the contribution of both the transmissibility advantage and generation time to the growth advantage of a variant. We find that the growth advantage depends on the epidemiological context (level of epidemic control). More specifically, variants conferring earlier transmission are more strongly favoured when the historical strains have fast epidemic growth, while variants conferring later transmission are more strongly favoured when historical strains have slow or negative growth. We develop these conceptual insights into a statistical framework to infer both the transmissibility advantage and generation time of a variant. On simulated data, our framework correctly estimates both parameters when it covers time periods characterized by different epidemiological contexts. Applied to data for the Alpha and Delta variants in England and in Europe, we find that Alpha confers a +54% [95% CI, 45-63%] transmissibility advantage compared to previous strains, and Delta +140% [98-182%] compared to Alpha, and mean generation times are similar to historical strains for both variants.

The recent structural and biophysical studies provided important evidence about multiple conformational substates of the D614G spike protein. The development of a plausible mechanistic model which can explain the experimental observations from a more unified thermodynamic perspective is an important objective of the current work. In this study, we employed efficient and accurate coarse-grained simulations of multiple structural substates of the D614G spike trimers together with the ensemble-based mutational frustration analysis to characterize the dynamics signatures of the conformational landscapes. By combining the local frustration profiling of the conformational states with residue-based mutational scanning of protein stability and network analysis of allosteric interactions and communications, we determine the patterns of mutational sensitivity in the functional regions and sites of variants. We found that the D614G mutation may induce a considerable conformational adaptability of the open states in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein without compromising folding stability and integrity of the spike protein. The results suggest that the D614G mutant may employ a hinge-shift mechanism in which the dynamic couplings between the site of mutation and the inter-protomer hinge modulate the inter-domain interactions, global mobility change and the increased stability of the open form. This study proposes that mutation-induced modulation of the conformational flexibility and energetic frustration at the inter-protomer interfaces may serve as an efficient mechanism for allosteric regulation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins."}, {"title": "Structural Insights of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein from Delta and Omicron Variants", "doi": "10.1101/2021.12.08.471777", "rxiv_url": "http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.08.471777", "rxiv_date": "2021-12-09", "rxiv_site": "biorxiv", "affs": [" Biology Program, Trinity School of Arts and Sciences, Duke University;", " University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center;", " UTSW: The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center"], "journal": null, "journal_doi": null, "journal_date_received": null, "journal_date_accepted": null, "journal_date_published": null, "journal_url": null, "abstract": "Given the continuing heavy toll of the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of the Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants, the WHO declared both as variants of concern (VOC). There are valid concerns that the latest Omicron variant might have increased infectivity and pathogenicity. In addition, the sheer number of S protein mutations in the Omicron variant raise concerns of potential immune evasion and resistance to therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies. However, structural insights that underpin the potential increased pathogenicity are unknown. Here we adopted an artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach to predict the structural changes induced by mutations of the Delta and Omicron variants in the spike (S) protein using Alphafold. This was followed by docking the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with the predicted S proteins for Wuhan-Hu-1, Delta, and Omicron variants. Our in-silico structural analysis indicates that S protein for Omicron variant has a higher binding affinity to ACE-2 receptor, compared to Wuhan-Hu-1 and Delta variants. In addition, the recognition sites of the receptor binding domains for Delta and Omicron variants showed lower electronegativity compared to Wuhan-Hu-1. Importantly, further molecular insights revealed significant changes induced at fusion protein (FP) site, which may mediate enhanced viral entry. These results represent the first computational analysis of structural changes associated with Omicron variant using Alphafold, Collectively, our results highlight potential structural basis for enhanced pathogenicity of the Omicron variant, however further validation using X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM are warranted."}, {"title": "Delta breakthrough infections elicit potent, broad and durable neutralizing antibody responses", "doi": "10.1101/2021.12.08.471707", "rxiv_url": "http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.08.471707", "rxiv_date": "2021-12-09", "rxiv_site": "biorxiv", "affs": ["University of Washington"], "journal": null, "journal_doi": null, "journal_date_received": null, "journal_date_accepted": null, "journal_date_published": null, "journal_url": null, "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant is currently responsible for most infections worldwide, including among vaccinated individuals.

Machine learning algorithms integrating 139 parameters identified IL-6 and CCL2 as two factors predictive of severe disease, consistent with the therapeutic benefit observed with anti-IL6-R antibody treatment. However, transcripts encoding these cytokines were not detected among circulating immune cells. Rather, in situ analysis of lung specimens using RNAscope and immunofluorescent staining revealed that elevated IL-6 and CCL2 were dominantly produced by infected lung type II pneumocytes. Severe disease was not associated with higher viral load, deficient antibody responses, or dysfunctional T cell responses. These results refine our understanding of severe COVID-19 pathophysiology, indicating that aberrant cytokine production by infected lung epithelial cells is a major driver of immunopathology.

We investigated SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroprevalence and seroconversions rates in secondary schools during the 2020/21 academic year, which included the emergence of the more transmissible Alpha and Delta variants, in England. Methods The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) initiated prospective surveillance in 18 urban English secondary schools. Participants had nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and blood sampling for SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein and Spike protein antibodies at the start (Round 1: September-October 2020) and end (Round 2: December 2021) of the autumn term, when schools reopened after national lockdown was imposed in January 2021 (Round 3: March-April) and end of the academic year (Round 4: May-July). Findings We enrolled 2,314 participants (1277 students, 1037 staff). In-school testing identified 31 PCR-positive participants (20 students, 11 staff). Another 247 confirmed cases (112 students, 135 staff) were identified after linkage with national surveillance data, giving an overall positivity rate of 12.0% (278/2313; staff [14.1%, 146/1037] vs students [10.3%, 132/1276; p=0.006). Nucleoprotein-antibody seroprevalence increased for students and staff between Rounds 1-3 but changed little in Round 4, when the Delta variant was the dominant circulating strain. Overall, Nucleoprotein-antibody seroconversion was 18.4% (137/744) in staff and 18.8% (146/778) in students, while Spike-antibody seroconversion was higher in staff (72.8% (525/721) than students (21.3%, 163/764) because of vaccination. Interpretation SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in secondary schools remained low when community infection rates were low because of national lockdown, even after the emergence of the Delta variant"}]
