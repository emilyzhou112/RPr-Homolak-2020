FOR THIS PURPOSE, A QUESTIONNAIRE-BASED SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED. THE HYPOTHESIS PROPOSED SUGGESTS THAT ADOPTION OF SOCIAL DISTANCING PRACTICES IS AN OUTCOME OF SITUATIONAL AWARENESS WHICH IS ACHIEVED BY THE INFORMATION SOURCES. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT INFORMATION SOURCES FORMAL (P=0.001) AND INFORMAL (P=0.007) WERE FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO PERCEIVED UNDERSTANDING. FINDINGS ALSO INDICATE THAT SOCIAL DISTANCING IS SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY SITUATIONAL AWARENESS P=0.000.

IN FACE OF THE HEALTH EMERGENCY, DRUG REPOSITIONING IS THE MOST RELIABLE OPTION TO DESIGN AN EFFICIENT THERAPY FOR INFECTED PATIENTS WITHOUT DELAY. THE FIRST STEP OF THE VIRAL REPLICATION CYCLE, I.E. THE ATTACHMENT TO THE SURFACE OF RESPIRATORY CELLS MEDIATED BY THE SPIKE (S) VIRAL PROTEIN, OFFERS SEVERAL POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC TARGETS. THE S PROTEIN USES THE ACE-2 RECEPTOR FOR ENTRY, BUT ALSO SIALIC ACIDS LINKED TO HOST CELL SURFACE GANGLIOSIDES. USING A COMBINATION OF STRUCTURAL AND MOLECULAR MODELING APPROACHES, WE SHOWED THAT CHLOROQUINE (CLQ), ONE OF THE DRUGS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR SARS-COV-2 TREATMENT, BINDS SIALIC ACIDS AND GANGLIOSIDES WITH HIGH AFFINITY. WE IDENTIFIED A NEW TYPE OF GANGLIOSIDE-BINDING DOMAIN AT THE TIP OF THE N-TERMINAL DOMAIN OF THE SARS-COV-2 SPIKE (S) PROTEIN. THIS DOMAIN (AA 111-158), WHICH IS FULLY CONSERVED AMONG CLINICAL ISOLATES WORLDWIDE, MAY IMPROVE THE ATTACHMENT OF THE VIRUS TO LIPID RAFTS AND FACILITATE THE CONTACT WITH THE ACE-2 RECEPTOR. WE SHOWED THAT IN PRESENCE OF CLQ (OR OF THE MORE ACTIVE DERIVATIVE HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE, CLQ-OH), THE VIRAL SPIKE IS NO LONGER ABLE TO BIND GANGLIOSIDES. THE IDENTIFICATION OF THIS NEW MECHANISM OF ACTION OF CLQ AND CLQ-OH SUPPORTS THE USE OF THESE REPOSITIONED DRUGS TO CURE SARS-COV-2 INFECTED PATIENTS AND STOP THE PANDEMIC. OUR IN SILICO APPROACHES MIGHT ALSO BE USED TO ASSESS THE EFFICIENCY OF A BROAD RANGE OF REPOSITIONED AND/OR INNOVATIVE DRUG CANDIDATES BEFORE THEIR CLINICAL EVALUATION.","INSERM UMR_S 1072, 13015 MARSEILLE, FRANCE; AIX-MARSEILLE UNIVERSITÉ, 13015 MARSEILLE;INMED, INSERM U1249, PARC SCIENTIFIQUE DE LUMINY, 163 AVENUE DE LUMINY, BP13 13273 MARSEILLE CEDEX 09, FRANCE.;INSERM UMR_S 1072, 13015 MARSEILLE, FRANCE; AIX-MARSEILLE UNIVERSITÉ, 13015 MARSEILLE, FRANCE.;INSERM UMR_S 1072, 13015 MARSEILLE, FRANCE; AIX-MARSEILLE UNIVERSITÉ, 13015 MARSEILLE, FRANCE.","NA",0,"1872-7913","INT.

PUBLIC HEALTH","ENGLAND","ENG","JOURNAL ARTICLE","","","","THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) PANDEMIC IS LEADING TO SOCIAL (PHYSICAL) DISTANCING POLICIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING IN THE USA. SOME OF THE FIRST ACTIONS TAKEN BY GOVERNMENTS ARE THE CLOSING OF SCHOOLS. THE EVIDENCE THAT MANDATORY SCHOOL CLOSURES REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CASES AND, ULTIMATELY, MORTALITY COMES FROM EXPERIENCE WITH INFLUENZA OR FROM MODELS THAT DO NOT INCLUDE THE EFFECT OF SCHOOL CLOSURE ON THE HEALTH-CARE LABOUR FORCE. THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS FROM SCHOOL CLOSURES NEED TO BE WEIGHED AGAINST COSTS OF HEALTH-CARE WORKER ABSENTEEISM ASSOCIATED WITH ADDITIONAL CHILD-CARE OBLIGATIONS. IN THIS STUDY, WE AIMED TO MEASURE CHILD-CARE OBLIGATIONS FOR US HEALTH-CARE WORKERS ARISING FROM SCHOOL CLOSURES WHEN THESE ARE USED AS A SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURE. WE THEN ASSESSED HOW IMPORTANT THE CONTRIBUTION OF HEALTH-CARE WORKERS WOULD HAVE TO BE IN REDUCING MORTALITY FOR THEIR ABSENTEEISM DUE TO CHILD-CARE OBLIGATIONS TO UNDO THE BENEFITS OF SCHOOL CLOSURES IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CASES. FOR THIS MODELLING ANALYSIS, WE USED DATA FROM THE MONTHLY RELEASES OF THE US CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY TO CHARACTERISE THE FAMILY STRUCTURE AND PROBABLE WITHIN-HOUSEHOLD CHILD-CARE OPTIONS OF US HEALTH-CARE WORKERS. WE ACCOUNTED FOR THE OCCUPATION WITHIN THE HEALTH-CARE SECTOR, STATE, AND HOUSEHOLD STRUCTURE TO IDENTIFY THE SEGMENTS OF THE HEALTH-CARE WORKFORCE THAT ARE MOST EXPOSED TO CHILD-CARE OBLIGATIONS FROM SCHOOL CLOSURES. WE USED THESE ESTIMATES TO IDENTIFY THE CRITICAL LEVEL AT WHICH THE IMPORTANCE OF HEALTH-CARE LABOUR SUPPLY IN INCREASING THE SURVIVAL PROBABILITY OF A PATIENT WITH COVID-19 WOULD UNDO THE BENEFITS OF SCHOOL CLOSURES AND ULTIMATELY INCREASE CUMULATIVE MORTALITY. BETWEEN JANUARY, 2018, AND JANUARY, 2020, THE US CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY INCLUDED INFORMATION ON MORE THAN 3·1 MILLION INDIVIDUALS ACROSS 1·3 MILLION HOUSEHOLDS. WE FOUND THAT THE US HEALTH-CARE SECTOR HAS SOME OF THE HIGHEST CHILD-CARE OBLIGATIONS IN THE USA, WITH 28·8% (95% CI 28·5-29·1) OF THE HEALTH-CARE WORKFORCE NEEDING TO PROVIDE CARE FOR CHILDREN AGED 3-12 YEARS. ASSUMING NON-WORKING ADULTS OR A SIBLING AGED 13 YEARS OR OLDER CAN PROVIDE CHILD CARE, 15·0% (14·8-15·2) OF THE HEALTH-CARE WORKFORCE WOULD STILL BE IN NEED OF CHILD CARE DURING A SCHOOL CLOSURE. WE OBSERVED SUBSTANTIAL VARIATION WITHIN THE HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM. WE ESTIMATED THAT, COMBINED WITH REASONABLE PARAMETERS FOR COVID-19 SUCH AS A 15·0% CASE REDUCTION FROM SCHOOL CLOSINGS AND 2·0% BASELINE MORTALITY RATE, A 15·0% DECREASE IN THE HEALTH-CARE LABOUR FORCE WOULD NEED TO DECREASE THE SURVIVAL PROBABILITY PER PERCENT HEALTH-CARE WORKER LOST BY 17·6% FOR A SCHOOL CLOSURE TO INCREASE CUMULATIVE MORTALITY. OUR MODEL ESTIMATES THAT IF THE INFECTION MORTALITY RATE OF COVID-19 INCREASES FROM 2·00% TO 2·35% WHEN THE HEALTH-CARE WORKFORCE DECLINES BY 15·0%, SCHOOL CLOSURES COULD LEAD TO A GREATER NUMBER OF DEATHS THAN THEY PREVENT. SCHOOL CLOSURES COME WITH MANY TRADE-OFFS, AND CAN CREATE UNINTENDED CHILD-CARE OBLIGATIONS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE POTENTIAL CONTAGION PREVENTION FROM SCHOOL CLOSURES NEEDS TO BE CAREFULLY WEIGHTED WITH THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF HEALTH-CARE WORKERS FROM THE STANDPOINT OF REDUCING CUMULATIVE MORTALITY DUE TO COVID-19, IN THE ABSENCE OF MITIGATING MEASURES.

WHERE VARIATIONS IN THE VIRAL SPIKE PROTEIN IN TURN LEAD TO THE CROSS SPECIES TRANSMISSION OF THE VIRUS, GENETIC VARIATIONS IN THE HOST RECEPTOR ACE2, MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUSCEPTIBILITY AND/OR RESISTANCE AGAINST THE VIRAL INFECTION. THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXPLORE THE BINDING OF THE PROTEINS ENCODED BY DIFFERENT HUMAN ACE2 ALLELIC VARIANTS WITH SARS-COV-2 SPIKE PROTEIN. BRIEFLY, CODING VARIANTS OF ACE2 CORRESPONDING TO THE REPORTED BINDING SITES FOR ITS ATTACHMENT WITH CORONAVIRUS SPIKE PROTEIN WERE SELECTED AND MOLECULAR MODELS OF THESE VARIANTS WERE CONSTRUCTED BY HOMOLOGY MODELLING. THE MODELS WERE THEN SUPERIMPOSED OVER THE NATIVE ACE2 AND ACE2-SPIKE PROTEIN COMPLEX, TO OBSERVE STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN THE ACE2 VARIANTS AND THEIR INTERMOLECULAR INTERACTIONS WITH SARS-COV-2 SPIKE PROTEIN RESPECTIVELY. DESPITE STRONG OVERALL STRUCTURAL SIMILARITIES, SPATIAL ORIENTATION OF THE KEY INTERACTING RESIDUES VARIES IN THE ACE2 VARIANTS COMPARED TO THE WILD TYPE MOLECULE. MOST ACE2 VARIANTS SHOWED SIMILAR BINDING AFFINITY FOR SARS-COV-2 SPIKE PROTEIN AS OBSERVED IN THE COMPLEX STRUCTURE OF WILD TYPE ACE2 AND SARS-COV-2 SPIKE PROTEIN. HOWEVER, ACE2 ALLELES, RS73635825 (S19P) AND RS143936283 (E329G) SHOWED NOTICEABLE VARIATIONS IN THEIR INTERMOLECULAR INTERACTIONS WITH THE VIRAL SPIKE PROTEIN.

CHILDREN AND ADULTS SHOW A DIFFERENT CLINICAL COURSE. THE PURPOSE OF THE CURRENT STUDY IS TO COMPARATIVELY ANALYZE THE CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF 2019-NCOV INFECTION IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS AND TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBLE CAUSES FOR THE DISCREPANCIES PRESENT. THE MEDICAL RECORDS OF 25 ADULTS AND 7 CHILDREN CONFIRMED CASES OF 2019-NCOV ARD WERE REVIEWED RETROSPECTIVELY. ALL CHILDREN WERE FAMILY CLUSTERS. THE TOTAL ADULT PATIENTS WERE DIFFERENTIATED INTO: THE LOCAL RESIDENTS OF WUHAN, A HISTORY OF TRAVEL TO WUHAN AND DIRECT CONTACT WITH PEOPLE FROM WUHAN. THE NUMBERS WERE 14 (56%), 10 (40%) & 1 (4%), RESPECTIVELY. THE MEDIAN INCUBATION PERIOD OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS WAS 5 DAYS (RANGE 3-12 DAYS) AND 4 DAYS (RANGE 2-12 DAYS), RESPECTIVELY. DIARRHOEA AND/OR VOMITING (57.1%) WERE MORE COMMON IN CHILDREN, WHEREAS FOR ADULTS IT WAS MYALGIA OR FATIGUE (52%). ON ADMISSION, THE PERCENTAGE OF CHILDREN HAVING PNEUMONIA (5, 71.4%) WAS ROUGHLY THE SAME AS ADULTS (20, 80%). 20% OF ADULTS HAD LEUCOPOENIA, BUT LEUKOCYTOSIS WAS MORE FREQUENTLY IN CHILDREN (28.6%, P=0.014). A HIGHER NUMBER OF CHILDREN HAD ELEVATED CREATINE KINASE ISOENZYME (57.1% VS. 4%, P=0.004). ANTIVIRAL THERAPY WAS GIVEN TO ALL ADULT PATIENTS BUT TO NONE OF THE CHILDREN.

UNDERSTANDING THE EVOLVING EPIDEMIOLOGY AND TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS OF THE OUTBREAK BEYOND HUBEI WOULD PROVIDE TIMELY INFORMATION TO GUIDE INTERVENTION POLICY. WE COLLECTED INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FROM OFFICIAL PUBLIC SOURCES ON LABORATORY-CONFIRMED CASES REPORTED OUTSIDE HUBEI IN MAINLAND CHINA FOR THE PERIOD OF JAN 19 TO FEB 17, 2020. WE USED THE DATE OF THE FOURTH REVISION OF THE CASE DEFINITION (JAN 27) TO DIVIDE THE EPIDEMIC INTO TWO TIME PERIODS (DEC 24 TO JAN 27, AND JAN 28 TO FEB 17) AS THE DATE OF SYMPTOM ONSET. WE ESTIMATED TRENDS IN THE DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF CASES AND KEY TIME-TO-EVENT INTERVALS. WE USED A BAYESIAN APPROACH TO ESTIMATE THE DYNAMICS OF THE NET REPRODUCTION NUMBER (R ) AT THE PROVINCIAL LEVEL. WE COLLECTED DATA ON 8579 CASES FROM 30 PROVINCES. THE MEDIAN AGE OF CASES WAS 44 YEARS (33-56), WITH AN INCREASING PROPORTION OF CASES IN YOUNGER AGE GROUPS AND IN ELDERLY PEOPLE (IE, AGED >64 YEARS) AS THE EPIDEMIC PROGRESSED. THE MEAN TIME FROM SYMPTOM ONSET TO HOSPITAL ADMISSION DECREASED FROM 4·4 DAYS (95% CI 0·0-14·0) FOR THE PERIOD OF DEC 24 TO JAN 27, TO 2·6 DAYS (0·0-9·0) FOR THE PERIOD OF JAN 28 TO FEB 17. THE MEAN INCUBATION PERIOD FOR THE ENTIRE PERIOD WAS ESTIMATED AT 5·2 DAYS (1·8-12·4) AND THE MEAN SERIAL INTERVAL AT 5·1 DAYS (1·3-11·6). THE EPIDEMIC DYNAMICS IN PROVINCES OUTSIDE HUBEI WERE HIGHLY VARIABLE BUT CONSISTENTLY INCLUDED A MIXTURE OF CASE IMPORTATIONS AND LOCAL TRANSMISSION. WE ESTIMATED THAT THE EPIDEMIC WAS SELF-SUSTAINED FOR LESS THAN 3 WEEKS, WITH MEAN RT REACHING PEAKS BETWEEN 1·08 (95% CI 0·74-1·54) IN SHENZHEN CITY OF GUANGDONG PROVINCE AND 1·71 (1·32-2·17) IN SHANDONG PROVINCE. IN ALL THE LOCATIONS FOR WHICH WE HAD SUFFICIENT DATA COVERAGE OF RT, RT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE BELOW THE EPIDEMIC THRESHOLD (IE, <1) AFTER JAN 30. OUR ESTIMATES OF THE INCUBATION PERIOD AND SERIAL INTERVAL WERE SIMILAR, SUGGESTING AN EARLY PEAK OF INFECTIOUSNESS, WITH POSSIBLE TRANSMISSION BEFORE THE ONSET OF SYMPTOMS.

AWARENESS OF THE BIOLOGICAL FEATURES OF 2019-NCOV SHOULD BE UPDATED IN TIME AND NEEDS TO BE COMPREHENSIVELY SUMMARIZED TO HELP OPTIMIZE CONTROL MEASURES AND MAKE THERAPEUTIC DECISIONS.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES","UNITED STATES","ENG","JOURNAL ARTICLE","","","","THE INCIDENCE OF CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) IN WUHAN, CHINA, HAS BEEN ESTIMATED USING IMPORTED CASE COUNTS OF INTERNATIONAL TRAVELLERS, GENERALLY UNDER THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT ALL CASES OF THE DISEASE IN TRAVELLERS HAVE BEEN ASCERTAINED AND THAT INFECTION PREVALENCE IN TRAVELLERS AND RESIDENTS IS THE SAME. HOWEVER, FINDINGS INDICATE VARIATION AMONG LOCATIONS IN THE CAPACITY FOR DETECTION OF IMPORTED CASES. SINGAPORE HAS HAD VERY STRONG EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SURVEILLANCE AND CONTACT TRACING CAPACITY DURING PREVIOUS INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAKS AND HAS CONSISTENTLY SHOWN HIGH SENSITIVITY OF CASE-DETECTION DURING THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK. WE USED A BAYESIAN MODELLING APPROACH TO ESTIMATE THE RELATIVE CAPACITY FOR DETECTION OF IMPORTED CASES OF COVID-19 FOR 194 LOCATIONS (EXCLUDING CHINA) COMPARED WITH THAT FOR SINGAPORE. WE ALSO BUILT A SIMPLE MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF THE POINT PREVALENCE OF INFECTION IN VISITORS TO AN EPICENTRE RELATIVE TO THAT IN RESIDENTS. THE WEIGHTED GLOBAL ABILITY TO DETECT WUHAN-TO-LOCATION IMPORTED CASES OF COVID-19 WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 38% (95% HIGHEST POSTERIOR DENSITY INTERVAL [HPDI] 22-64) OF SINGAPORE'S CAPACITY. THIS VALUE IS EQUIVALENT TO 2·8 (95% HPDI 1·5-4·4) TIMES THE CURRENT NUMBER OF IMPORTED AND REPORTED CASES THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DETECTED IF ALL LOCATIONS HAD HAD THE SAME DETECTION CAPACITY AS SINGAPORE. USING THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THE GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY INDEX TO STRATIFY LIKELY CASE-DETECTION CAPACITIES, THE ABILITY TO DETECT IMPORTED CASES RELATIVE TO SINGAPORE WAS 40% (95% HPDI 22-67) AMONG LOCATIONS WITH HIGH SURVEILLANCE CAPACITY, 37% (18-68) AMONG LOCATIONS WITH MEDIUM SURVEILLANCE CAPACITY, AND 11% (0-42) AMONG LOCATIONS WITH LOW SURVEILLANCE CAPACITY. TREATING ALL TRAVELLERS AS IF THEY WERE RESIDENTS (RATHER THAN ACCOUNTING FOR THE BRIEF STAY OF SOME OF THESE TRAVELLERS IN WUHAN) CONTRIBUTED MODESTLY TO UNDERESTIMATION OF PREVALENCE. ESTIMATES OF CASE COUNTS IN WUHAN BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS OF 100% DETECTION IN TRAVELLERS COULD HAVE BEEN UNDERESTIMATED BY SEVERAL FOLD. FURTHERMORE, SEVERITY ESTIMATES WILL BE INFLATED SEVERAL FOLD SINCE THEY ALSO RELY ON CASE COUNT ESTIMATES. FINALLY, OUR MODEL SUPPORTS EVIDENCE THAT UNDERDETECTED CASES OF COVID-19 HAVE PROBABLY SPREAD IN MOST LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, WITH GREATEST RISK IN LOCATIONS OF LOW DETECTION CAPACITY AND HIGH CONNECTIVITY TO THE EPICENTRE OF THE OUTBREAK.

HOWEVER, THE TRANSMISSION ROUTE OF SARS-COV-2 HAS NOT BEEN FULLY UNDERSTOOD. IN THIS STUDY, WE AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE SARS-COV-2 SHEDDING IN EXCRETA OF COVID-19 PATIENTS. ELECTRONICAL MEDICAL RECORDS, INCLUDING DEMOGRAPHICS, CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS, LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGICAL FINDINGS, OF ENROLLED PATIENTS WERE EXTRACTED AND ANALYZED. PHARYNGEAL SWAB, STOOL AND URINE SPECIMENS WERE COLLECTED AND TESTED FOR SARS-COV-2 RNA BY RT-PCR. VIRAL SHEDDING AT MULTIPLE TIME POINTS IN SPECIMENS WAS RECORDED, AND ANALYZED ITS CORRELATION WITH CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND THE SEVERITY OF ILLNESS. A TOTAL OF 42 LABORATORY-CONFIRMED PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED, 8 (19.05%) OF WHOM HAD GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS. 28 (66.67%) PATIENTS TESTED POSITIVE FOR SARS-COV-2 RNA IN STOOL SPECIMENS, WHICH WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRESENCE OF GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS AND THE SEVERITY OF ILLNESS. AMONG THEM, 18 (64.29%) PATIENTS REMAINED POSITIVE FOR VIRAL RNA IN FECES AFTER PHARYNGEAL SWABS TURNED NEGATIVE. THE DURATION OF VIRAL SHEDDING FROM FECES AFTER NEGATIVE CONVERSION IN PHARYNGEAL SWABS WAS 7 (6-10) DAYS, REGARDLESS OF COVID-19 SEVERITY. THE DEMOGRAPHICS, CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS, LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC FINDINGS DID NO DIFFER BETWEEN PATIENTS TESTED POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE FOR SARS-COV-2 RNA IN FECES. VIRAL RNA WAS NOT DETECTABLE IN URINE SPECIMENS FROM 10 PATIENTS. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THE PRESENCE OF SARS-COV-2 RNA IN FECES OF COVID-19 PATIENTS, AND SUGGESTED THE POSSIBILITY OF SARS-COV-2 TRANSMISSION VIA THE FECAL-ORAL ROUTE.

WE SEARCHED FIVE MEDICAL DATABASES INCLUDING TWO CHINESE AND THREE ENGLISH DATABASES FOR ALL PUBLISHED ARTICLES ON COVID-19 SINCE THE OUTBREAK. A RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL WAS DESIGNED, AND THE IMAGING AND CLINICAL DATA FROM ALL STUDIES WERE COLLECTED FOR META-ANALYSIS. OVERALL, 31 ARTICLES AND 46 959 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED, INCLUDING 10 ENGLISH ARTICLES AND 21 CHINESE ARTICLES. THE RESULTS OF META-ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE MOST COMMON CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS WERE FEVER (87.3%; 0.838-0.909), COUGH (58.1%; 0.502-0.660), DYSPNEA (38.3%; 0.246-0.520), MUSCLE SORENESS OR FATIGUE (35.5%; 0.253-0.456), AND CHEST DISTRESS (31.2%; -0.024 TO 0.648). THE MAIN IMAGING FINDINGS WERE BILATERAL PNEUMONIA (75.7%; 0.639-0.871) AND GROUND-GLASS OPACIFICATION (69.9%; 0.602-0.796). AMONG THE PATIENTS, THE INCIDENCE THAT REQUIRED INTENSIVE CARE UNIT (ICU) WAS (29.3%; 0.190-0.395), THE INCIDENCE WITH ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME WAS (28.8%; 0.147-0.429), THE INCIDENCE WITH MULTIPLE ORGAN DYSFUNCTION SYNDROME WAS (8.5%; -0.008 TO 0.179), AND THE CASE FATALITY RATE OF PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 WAS (6.8%; 0.044-0.093). COVID-19 IS A NEW CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASE THAT MAINLY CAUSES BILATERAL PNEUMONIA AND LUNG FUNCTION DETERIORATES RAPIDLY.

ONE OF THE INTERVENTIONS IMPLEMENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT IS A SCHOOL CLOSURE. THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION DECIDED TO POSTPONE THE SCHOOL OPENING FROM MARCH 2 TO APRIL 6 TO MINIMIZE EPIDEMIC SIZE. WE AIMED TO QUANTIFY THE SCHOOL CLOSURE EFFECT ON THE COVID-19 EPIDEMIC. THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF SCHOOL OPENING WERE MEASURED USING A MATHEMATICAL MODEL CONSIDERING TWO AGE GROUPS: CHILDREN (AGED 19 YEARS AND YOUNGER) AND ADULTS (AGED OVER 19). BASED ON SUSCEPTIBLE-EXPOSED-INFECTIOUS-RECOVERED MODEL, ISOLATION AND BEHAVIOR-CHANGED SUSCEPTIBLE INDIVIDUALS ARE ADDITIONALLY CONSIDERED. THE TRANSMISSION PARAMETERS WERE ESTIMATED FROM THE LABORATORY CONFIRMED DATA REPORTED BY THE KOREA CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION FROM FEBRUARY 16 TO MARCH 22. THE MODEL WAS EXTENDED WITH ESTIMATED PARAMETERS AND ESTIMATED THE EXPECTED NUMBER OF CONFIRMED CASES AS THE TRANSMISSION RATE INCREASED AFTER SCHOOL OPENING. ASSUMING THE TRANSMISSION RATE BETWEEN CHILDREN GROUP WOULD BE INCREASING 10 FOLD AFTER THE SCHOOLS OPEN, APPROXIMATELY ADDITIONAL 60 CASES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR FROM MARCH 2 TO MARCH 9, AND APPROXIMATELY ADDITIONAL 100 CHILDREN CASES ARE EXPECTED FROM MARCH 9 TO MARCH 23. AFTER MARCH 23, THE NUMBER OF EXPECTED CASES FOR CHILDREN IS 28.4 FOR 7 DAYS AND 33.6 FOR 14 DAYS. THE SIMULATION RESULTS SHOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT COULD REDUCE AT LEAST 200 CASES, WITH TWO ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION.

ALL OF THE CASES CONFIRMED BY REAL TIME POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION WERE ENROLLED FROM THE 1ST TO THE 28TH PATIENT NATIONWIDE. CLINICAL DATA WERE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED FOR CHANGES IN CLINICAL SEVERITY INCLUDING LABORATORY, RADIOLOGICAL, AND VIROLOGIC DYNAMICS DURING THE PROGRESSION OF ILLNESS. THE MEDIAN AGE WAS 40 YEARS (RANGE, 20-73 YEARS) AND 15 (53.6%) PATIENTS WERE MALE. THE MOST COMMON SYMPTOMS WERE COUGH (28.6%) AND SORE THROAT (28.6%), FOLLOWED BY FEVER (25.0%). DIARRHEA WAS NOT COMMON (10.7%). TWO PATIENTS HAD NO SYMPTOMS. INITIAL CHEST X-RAY (CXR) SHOWED INFILTRATION IN 46.4% OF THE PATIENTS, BUT COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SCAN CONFIRMED PNEUMONIA IN 88.9% (16/18) OF THE PATIENTS. SIX PATIENTS (21.4%) REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN THERAPY, BUT NO ONE NEEDED MECHANICAL VENTILATION. LYMPHOPENIA WAS MORE COMMON IN SEVERE CASES. HIGHER LEVEL OF C-REACTIVE PROTEIN AND WORSENING OF CHEST RADIOGRAPHIC SCORE WAS OBSERVED DURING THE 5-7 DAY PERIOD AFTER SYMPTOM ONSET. VIRAL SHEDDING WAS HIGH FROM DAY 1 OF ILLNESS, ESPECIALLY FROM THE UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT (URT). THE PRODROMAL SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 WERE MILD AND MOST PATIENTS DID NOT HAVE LIMITATIONS OF DAILY ACTIVITY. VIRAL SHEDDING FROM URT WAS HIGH FROM THE PRODROMAL PHASE. RADIOLOGICAL PNEUMONIA WAS COMMON FROM THE EARLY DAYS OF ILLNESS, BUT IT WAS FREQUENTLY NOT EVIDENT IN SIMPLE CXR.

WE NEXT OBTAINED AGE-STRATIFIED ESTIMATES OF THE CASE FATALITY RATIO BY RELATING THE AGGREGATE DISTRIBUTION OF CASES TO THE OBSERVED CUMULATIVE DEATHS IN CHINA, ASSUMING A CONSTANT ATTACK RATE BY AGE AND ADJUSTING FOR DEMOGRAPHY AND AGE-BASED AND LOCATION-BASED UNDER-ASCERTAINMENT. WE ALSO ESTIMATED THE CASE FATALITY RATIO FROM INDIVIDUAL LINE-LIST DATA ON 1334 CASES IDENTIFIED OUTSIDE OF MAINLAND CHINA. USING DATA ON THE PREVALENCE OF PCR-CONFIRMED CASES IN INTERNATIONAL RESIDENTS REPATRIATED FROM CHINA, WE OBTAINED AGE-STRATIFIED ESTIMATES OF THE INFECTION FATALITY RATIO. FURTHERMORE, DATA ON AGE-STRATIFIED SEVERITY IN A SUBSET OF 3665 CASES FROM CHINA WERE USED TO ESTIMATE THE PROPORTION OF INFECTED INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LIKELY TO REQUIRE HOSPITALISATION. USING DATA ON 24 DEATHS THAT OCCURRED IN MAINLAND CHINA AND 165 RECOVERIES OUTSIDE OF CHINA, WE ESTIMATED THE MEAN DURATION FROM ONSET OF SYMPTOMS TO DEATH TO BE 17·8 DAYS (95% CREDIBLE INTERVAL [CRI] 16·9-19·2) AND TO HOSPITAL DISCHARGE TO BE 24·7 DAYS (22·9-28·1). IN ALL LABORATORY CONFIRMED AND CLINICALLY DIAGNOSED CASES FROM MAINLAND CHINA (N=70 117), WE ESTIMATED A CRUDE CASE FATALITY RATIO (ADJUSTED FOR CENSORING) OF 3·67% (95% CRI 3·56-3·80). HOWEVER, AFTER FURTHER ADJUSTING FOR DEMOGRAPHY AND UNDER-ASCERTAINMENT, WE OBTAINED A BEST ESTIMATE OF THE CASE FATALITY RATIO IN CHINA OF 1·38% (1·23-1·53), WITH SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER RATIOS IN OLDER AGE GROUPS (0·32% [0·27-0·38] IN THOSE AGED <60 YEARS VS 6·4% [5·7-7·2] IN THOSE AGED ≥60 YEARS), UP TO 13·4% (11·2-15·9) IN THOSE AGED 80 YEARS OR OLDER. ESTIMATES OF CASE FATALITY RATIO FROM INTERNATIONAL CASES STRATIFIED BY AGE WERE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE FROM CHINA (PARAMETRIC ESTIMATE 1·4% [0·4-3·5] IN THOSE AGED <60 YEARS [N=360] AND 4·5% [1·8-11·1] IN THOSE AGED ≥60 YEARS [N=151]). OUR ESTIMATED OVERALL INFECTION FATALITY RATIO FOR CHINA WAS 0·66% (0·39-1·33), WITH AN INCREASING PROFILE WITH AGE. SIMILARLY, ESTIMATES OF THE PROPORTION OF INFECTED INDIVIDUALS LIKELY TO BE HOSPITALISED INCREASED WITH AGE UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 18·4% (11·0-7·6) IN THOSE AGED 80 YEARS OR OLDER. THESE EARLY ESTIMATES GIVE AN INDICATION OF THE FATALITY RATIO ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF COVID-19 DISEASE AND SHOW A STRONG AGE GRADIENT IN RISK OF DEATH.

SOME STUDIES PROPOSED PANGOLIN, SNAKE, OR TURTLE AS THE INTERMEDIATE HOSTS. ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING ENZYME 2 (ACE2) IS THE RECEPTOR FOR SARS-COV-2, WHICH DETERMINES THE POTENTIAL HOST RANGE FOR SARS-COV-2. ON THE BASIS OF STRUCTURAL INFORMATION OF THE COMPLEX OF HUMAN ACE2 AND SARS-COV-2 RECEPTOR-BINDING DOMAIN (RBD), WE ANALYZED THE AFFINITY TO S PROTEIN OF THE 20 KEY RESIDUES IN ACE2 FROM MAMMAL, BIRD, TURTLE, AND SNAKE. SEVERAL ACE2 PROTEINS FROM PRIMATES, BOVIDAE, CRICETIDAE, AND CETACEA MAINTAINED THE MAJORITY OF KEY RESIDUES IN ACE2 FOR ASSOCIATING WITH SARS-COV-2 RBD. THE SIMULATED STRUCTURES INDICATED THAT ACE2 PROTEINS FROM BOVIDAE AND CRICETIDAE WERE ABLE TO ASSOCIATE WITH SARS-COV-2 RBD. WE FOUND THAT NEARLY HALF OF THE KEY RESIDUES IN TURTLE, SNAKE, AND BIRD WERE CHANGED. THE SIMULATED STRUCTURES SHOWED SEVERAL KEY CONTACTS WITH SARS-COV-2 RBD IN TURTLE AND SNAKE ACE2 WERE ABOLISHED. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT NEITHER SNAKE NOR TURTLE WAS THE INTERMEDIATE HOSTS FOR SARS-COV-2, WHICH FURTHER REINFORCED THE CONCEPT THAT THE REPTILES ARE RESISTANT AGAINST INFECTION OF CORONAVIRUS.

THE MAIN AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF EDUCATIONAL AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS (HCWS) REGARDING COVID-19, ITS CONTROL, AND PREVENTION. KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ORIGIN, SYMPTOMS, AND SPREAD OF VIRAL INFECTION WAS ASSESSED. IN THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY, A SELF-DESIGNED QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DISTRIBUTED AMONG 302 HCWS INCLUDING PHYSICIANS (10.9%), NURSES (1.32%), LAB STAFF (1.65%), AND ACADEMIC INDIVIDUALS INCLUDING FACULTY AND STUDENTS (86.42%) OF DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. RESULTS WERE ANALYZED USING THE Χ  TEST. OBTAINED RESULTS VALIDATE OUR NULL HYPOTHESIS THAT PAKISTANI MASSES ARE NOT WELL AWARE OF THE COVID-19 AND STRATEGIES FOR THE PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF INFECTION.

THEREFORE, THE TREATMENT OF CYTOKINE STORM HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT PART OF RESCUING SEVERE PATIENTS. INTERLEUKIN-6 (IL-6) PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME (CRS). IF IT CAN BLOCK THE SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAY OF IL-6, IT IS EXPECTED TO BECOME A NEW METHOD FOR THE TREATMENT OF SEVERE PATIENTS. TOCILIZUMAB IS A BLOCKER OF IL-6R, WHICH CAN EFFECTIVELY BLOCK IL-6 SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAY. SO, TOCILIZUMAB IS LIKELY TO BECOME AN EFFECTIVE DRUG FOR PATIENTS WITH SEVERE COVID-19.","DEPARTMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE, CENTER FOR LIVER DISEASE, PEKING UNIVERSITY FIRST HOSPITAL, NO.8 XISHIKU STREET, XICHENG DISTRICT, BEIJING, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE, CENTER FOR LIVER DISEASE, PEKING UNIVERSITY FIRST HOSPITAL, NO.8 XISHIKU STREET, XICHENG DISTRICT, BEIJING, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE, CENTER FOR LIVER DISEASE, PEKING UNIVERSITY FIRST HOSPITAL, NO.8 XISHIKU STREET, XICHENG DISTRICT, BEIJING, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE, CENTER FOR LIVER DISEASE, PEKING UNIVERSITY FIRST HOSPITAL, NO.8 XISHIKU STREET, XICHENG DISTRICT, BEIJING, CHINA; PEKING UNIVERSITY INTERNATIONAL HOSPITAL, BEIJING;DEPARTMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE, CENTER FOR LIVER DISEASE, PEKING UNIVERSITY FIRST HOSPITAL, NO.8 XISHIKU STREET, XICHENG DISTRICT, BEIJING, CHINA; THE COLLABORATIVE INNOVATION CENTER FOR DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES, ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY, HANGZHOU, ZHEJIANG, CHINA; PEKING UNIVERSITY INTERNATIONAL HOSPITAL, BEIJING","NA",0,"1872-7913","INT.

IT WAS FOUND THAT HIGHER CONCENTRATION IN VENOUS BLOOD OF CK-MB, MYO, ULTRA-TNI AND NT-PROBNP WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEVERITY AND CASE-FATALITY RATE OF COVID-19. CAREFUL MONITORING OF THE MYOCARDIAC ENZYME PROFILES IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IN REDUCING THE COMPLICATIONS AND MORTALITY IN COVID-19 PATIENTS. THIS ARTICLE IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE SHORT-TERM EFFECT OF RISK-ADAPTED TREATMENT STRATEGY ON PATIENTS WITH COVID-19. WE COLLECTED THE MEDICAL RECORDS OF 55 COVID-19 PATIENTS FOR ANALYSIS. WE DIVIDED THESE PATIENTS INTO MILD, MODERATE AND SEVERE GROUPS, AND RISK-ADAPTED TREATMENT APPROACHES WERE GIVEN ACCORDING TO THE ILLNESS SEVERITY. TWELVE PATIENTS WERE IN MILD GROUP AND 22 WERE IN MODERATE GROUP (NON-SEVERE GROUP, N=34), AND 21 PATIENTS WERE IN SEVERE GROUP. AT THE END OF THE FIRST TWO WEEKS AFTER ADMISSION, CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS HAD COMPLETELY DESPEARED IN 31(91.2%)PATIENTS IN NON-SEVERE GROUP, AND 18(85.7%) PATIENTS IN SEVERE GROUP (P=0.85).

NATIONWIDE, THERE WERE MORE THAN 70,000 CONFIRMED CASES, AND 2500 DEATHS. MOST PATIENTS WERE ELDERLY, WITH SEVERE DISEASE. FOR ACUTE RESPIRATORY INFECTION, RT-PCR IS ROUTINELY USED TO DETECT CAUSATIVE VIRUSES IN RESPIRATORY SECRETIONS. CORONAVIRUS RNA CAN BE DETECTED FROM NOSE AND THROAT SWABS, SPUTUM AND OTHER LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT SECRETIONS, BLOOD AND FECES. SUCH SPECIMENS WERE EXAMINED BY RT-PCR. THREE TARGETS, RDRP, E AND N GENES WERE DETECTED, INDICATING SAMPLES WERE POSITIVE FOR SARS-COV-2]. AFTER PATIENT RECOVERY, A CHEST CT EXAMINATION, COMBINED WITH SARS-COV-2 RNA DETECTION, CONFIRMED DIAGNOSIS. HOWEVER, SOME RECOVERY PATIENTS WITH NEGATIVE RNA TESTS TURNED RNA POSITIVE. THE PRELIMINARY DATA IS ABOUT 14% OF DISCHARGED PATIENTS IN GUANGDONG REPORTED BY THE GUANGDONG CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (CDC). THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC ISSUE. IF SAMPLES ARE POSITIVE FOR SARS-COV-2 RNA, PATIENTS SHOULD BE MANAGED ACCORDING TO INFECTION SOURCE. FORTUNATELY, THERE WERE NO CLOSE CONTACTS OF SECOND-GENERATION CASES. WE HEREIN REPORT SIX SARS-COV-2 CASES CONFIRMED IN OUR HOSPITAL, FOR THE CHANGES OF RESULTS OF SARS-COV-2 RNA SHOULD ATTRACT ATTENTION.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES","UNITED STATES","ENG","JOURNAL ARTICLE","","","","ON DEC 31, 2019, CHINA REPORTED A CLUSTER OF CASES OF PNEUMONIA IN PEOPLE AT WUHAN, HUBEI PROVINCE. THE RESPONSIBLE PATHOGEN IS A NOVEL CORONAVIRUS, NAMED SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS 2 (SARS-COV-2). WE REPORT THE RELEVANT FEATURES OF THE FIRST CASES IN EUROPE OF CONFIRMED INFECTION, NAMED CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19), WITH THE FIRST PATIENT DIAGNOSED WITH THE DISEASE ON JAN 24, 2020. IN THIS CASE SERIES, WE FOLLOWED FIVE PATIENTS ADMITTED TO BICHAT-CLAUDE BERNARD UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL (PARIS, FRANCE) AND PELLEGRIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL (BORDEAUX, FRANCE) AND DIAGNOSED WITH COVID-19 BY SEMI-QUANTITATIVE RT-PCR ON NASOPHARYNGEAL SWABS. WE ASSESSED PATTERNS OF CLINICAL DISEASE AND VIRAL LOAD FROM DIFFERENT SAMPLES (NASOPHARYNGEAL AND BLOOD, URINE, AND STOOL SAMPLES), WHICH WERE OBTAINED ONCE DAILY FOR 3 DAYS FROM HOSPITAL ADMISSION, AND ONCE EVERY 2 OR 3 DAYS UNTIL PATIENT DISCHARGE. ALL SAMPLES WERE REFRIGERATED AND SHIPPED TO LABORATORIES IN THE NATIONAL REFERENCE CENTER FOR RESPIRATORY VIRUSES (THE INSTITUT PASTEUR, PARIS, AND HOSPICES CIVILS DE LYON, LYON, FRANCE), WHERE RNA EXTRACTION, REAL-TIME RT-PCR, AND VIRUS ISOLATION AND TITRATION PROCEDURES WERE DONE. THE PATIENTS WERE THREE MEN (AGED 31 YEARS, 48 YEARS, AND 80 YEARS) AND TWO WOMEN (AGED 30 YEARS AND 46 YEARS), ALL OF CHINESE ORIGIN, WHO HAD TRAVELLED TO FRANCE FROM CHINA AROUND MID-JANUARY, 2020. THREE DIFFERENT CLINICAL EVOLUTIONS ARE DESCRIBED: (1) TWO PAUCISYMPTOMATIC WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITHIN A DAY OF EXHIBITING SYMPTOMS, WITH HIGH NASOPHARYNGEAL TITRES OF SARS-COV-2 WITHIN THE FIRST 24 H OF THE ILLNESS ONSET (5·2 AND 7·4 LOG  COPIES PER 1000 CELLS, RESPECTIVELY) AND VIRAL RNA DETECTION IN STOOLS; (2) A TWO-STEP DISEASE PROGRESSION IN TWO YOUNG MEN, WITH A SECONDARY WORSENING AROUND 10 DAYS AFTER DISEASE ONSET DESPITE A DECREASING VIRAL LOAD IN NASOPHARYNGEAL SAMPLES; AND (3) AN 80-YEAR-OLD MAN WITH A RAPID EVOLUTION TOWARDS MULTIPLE ORGAN FAILURE AND A PERSISTENT HIGH VIRAL LOAD IN LOWER AND UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT WITH SYSTEMIC VIRUS DISSEMINATION AND VIRUS DETECTION IN PLASMA. THE 80-YEAR-OLD PATIENT DIED ON DAY 14 OF ILLNESS (FEB 14, 2020); ALL OTHER PATIENTS HAD RECOVERED AND BEEN DISCHARGED BY FEB 19, 2020. WE ILLUSTRATED THREE DIFFERENT CLINICAL AND BIOLOGICAL TYPES OF EVOLUTION IN FIVE PATIENTS INFECTED WITH SARS-COV-2 WITH DETAILED AND COMPREHENSIVE VIRAL SAMPLING STRATEGY. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE FINDINGS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE NATURAL HISTORY OF THE DISEASE AND WILL CONTRIBUTE TO ADVANCES IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MORE EFFICIENT INFECTION CONTROL STRATEGIES.

ACE2 IS A CRUCIAL COMPONENT OF THE RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM (RAS). THE CLASSICAL RAS ACE-ANG II-AT1R REGULATORY AXIS AND THE ACE2-ANG 1-7-MASR COUNTER-REGULATORY AXIS PLAY AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN MAINTAINING HOMEOSTASIS IN HUMANS. ACE2 IS WIDELY DISTRIBUTED IN THE HEART, KIDNEYS, LUNGS, AND TESTES. ACE2 ANTAGONIZES THE ACTIVATION OF THE CLASSICAL RAS SYSTEM AND PROTECTS AGAINST ORGAN DAMAGE, PROTECTING AGAINST HYPERTENSION, DIABETES, AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. SIMILAR TO SARS-COV, SARS-COV-2 ALSO USES THE ACE2 RECEPTOR TO INVADE HUMAN ALVEOLAR EPITHELIAL CELLS. ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS) IS A CLINICAL HIGH-MORTALITY DISEASE, AND ACE2 HAS A PROTECTIVE EFFECT ON THIS TYPE OF ACUTE LUNG INJURY. CURRENT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE POOR PROGNOSIS OF PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 IS RELATED TO FACTORS SUCH AS SEX (MALE), AGE (>60 YEARS), UNDERLYING DISEASES (HYPERTENSION, DIABETES, AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE), SECONDARY ARDS, AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. BECAUSE OF THESE PROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF ACE2 ON CHRONIC UNDERLYING DISEASES AND ARDS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF SPIKE PROTEIN-BASED VACCINE AND DRUGS ENHANCING ACE2 ACTIVITY MAY BECOME ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING APPROACHES FOR THE TREATMENT OF COVID-19 IN THE FUTURE.","DEPARTMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND THE CENTER FOR LIVER DISEASES, PEKING UNIVERSITY FIRST HOSPITAL, BEIJING, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND THE CENTER FOR LIVER DISEASES, PEKING UNIVERSITY FIRST HOSPITAL, BEIJING, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND THE CENTER FOR LIVER DISEASES, PEKING UNIVERSITY FIRST HOSPITAL, BEIJING, CHINA.;THE COLLABORATIVE INNOVATION CENTER FOR DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES, ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY, HANGZHOU, ZHEJIANG, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF LIVER DISEASES, PEKING UNIVERSITY INTERNATIONAL HOSPITAL, BEIJING, CHINA.","NA",0,"1096-9071","J.

PUBLIC HEALTH","ENGLAND","ENG","JOURNAL ARTICLE","","","","IN DECEMBER, 2019, SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS 2 (SARS-COV-2), A NOVEL CORONAVIRUS, EMERGED IN WUHAN, CHINA. SINCE THEN, THE CITY OF WUHAN HAS TAKEN UNPRECEDENTED MEASURES IN RESPONSE TO THE OUTBREAK, INCLUDING EXTENDED SCHOOL AND WORKPLACE CLOSURES. WE AIMED TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF PHYSICAL DISTANCING MEASURES ON THE PROGRESSION OF THE COVID-19 EPIDEMIC, HOPING TO PROVIDE SOME INSIGHTS FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD. TO EXAMINE HOW CHANGES IN POPULATION MIXING HAVE AFFECTED OUTBREAK PROGRESSION IN WUHAN, WE USED SYNTHETIC LOCATION-SPECIFIC CONTACT PATTERNS IN WUHAN AND ADAPTED THESE IN THE PRESENCE OF SCHOOL CLOSURES, EXTENDED WORKPLACE CLOSURES, AND A REDUCTION IN MIXING IN THE GENERAL COMMUNITY. USING THESE MATRICES AND THE LATEST ESTIMATES OF THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS OF THE WUHAN OUTBREAK, WE SIMULATED THE ONGOING TRAJECTORY OF AN OUTBREAK IN WUHAN USING AN AGE-STRUCTURED SUSCEPTIBLE-EXPOSED-INFECTED-REMOVED (SEIR) MODEL FOR SEVERAL PHYSICAL DISTANCING MEASURES. WE FITTED THE LATEST ESTIMATES OF EPIDEMIC PARAMETERS FROM A TRANSMISSION MODEL TO DATA ON LOCAL AND INTERNATIONALLY EXPORTED CASES FROM WUHAN IN AN AGE-STRUCTURED EPIDEMIC FRAMEWORK AND INVESTIGATED THE AGE DISTRIBUTION OF CASES. WE ALSO SIMULATED LIFTING OF THE CONTROL MEASURES BY ALLOWING PEOPLE TO RETURN TO WORK IN A PHASED-IN WAY AND LOOKED AT THE EFFECTS OF RETURNING TO WORK AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE UNDERLYING OUTBREAK (AT THE BEGINNING OF MARCH OR APRIL). OUR PROJECTIONS SHOW THAT PHYSICAL DISTANCING MEASURES WERE MOST EFFECTIVE IF THE STAGGERED RETURN TO WORK WAS AT THE BEGINNING OF APRIL; THIS REDUCED THE MEDIAN NUMBER OF INFECTIONS BY MORE THAN 92% (IQR 66-97) AND 24% (13-90) IN MID-2020 AND END-2020, RESPECTIVELY. THERE ARE BENEFITS TO SUSTAINING THESE MEASURES UNTIL APRIL IN TERMS OF DELAYING AND REDUCING THE HEIGHT OF THE PEAK, MEDIAN EPIDEMIC SIZE AT END-2020, AND AFFORDING HEALTH-CARE SYSTEMS MORE TIME TO EXPAND AND RESPOND. HOWEVER, THE MODELLED EFFECTS OF PHYSICAL DISTANCING MEASURES VARY BY THE DURATION OF INFECTIOUSNESS AND THE ROLE SCHOOL CHILDREN HAVE IN THE EPIDEMIC. RESTRICTIONS ON ACTIVITIES IN WUHAN, IF MAINTAINED UNTIL APRIL, WOULD PROBABLY HELP TO DELAY THE EPIDEMIC PEAK.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES","UNITED STATES","ENG","JOURNAL ARTICLE","","","","SINCE DECEMBER, 2019, AN OUTBREAK OF CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) HAS SPREAD GLOBALLY. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL FEATURES OF PAEDIATRIC PATIENTS WITH COVID-19. WE RETROSPECTIVELY RETRIEVED DATA FOR PAEDIATRIC PATIENTS (AGED 0-16 YEARS) WITH CONFIRMED COVID-19 FROM ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS IN THREE HOSPITALS IN ZHEJIANG, CHINA. WE RECORDED PATIENTS' EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL FEATURES. FROM JAN 17 TO MARCH 1, 2020, 36 CHILDREN (MEAN AGE 8·3 [SD 3·5] YEARS) WERE IDENTIFIED TO BE INFECTED WITH SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS 2. THE ROUTE OF TRANSMISSION WAS BY CLOSE CONTACT WITH FAMILY MEMBERS (32 [89%]) OR A HISTORY OF EXPOSURE TO THE EPIDEMIC AREA (12 [33%]); EIGHT (22%) PATIENTS HAD BOTH EXPOSURES. 19 (53%) PATIENTS HAD MODERATE CLINICAL TYPE WITH PNEUMONIA; 17 (47%) HAD MILD CLINICAL TYPE AND EITHER WERE ASYMPTOMATIC (TEN [28%]) OR HAD ACUTE UPPER RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS (SEVEN [19%]). COMMON SYMPTOMS ON ADMISSION WERE FEVER (13 [36%]) AND DRY COUGH (SEVEN [19%]). OF THOSE WITH FEVER, FOUR (11%) HAD A BODY TEMPERATURE OF 38·5°C OR HIGHER, AND NINE (25%) HAD A BODY TEMPERATURE OF 37·5-38·5°C. TYPICAL ABNORMAL LABORATORY FINDINGS WERE ELEVATED CREATINE KINASE MB (11 [31%]), DECREASED LYMPHOCYTES (11 [31%]), LEUCOPENIA (SEVEN [19%]), AND ELEVATED PROCALCITONIN (SIX [17%]). BESIDES RADIOGRAPHIC PRESENTATIONS, VARIABLES THAT WERE ASSOCIATED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH SEVERITY OF COVID-19 WERE DECREASED LYMPHOCYTES, ELEVATED BODY TEMPERATURE, AND HIGH LEVELS OF PROCALCITONIN, D-DIMER, AND CREATINE KINASE MB. ALL CHILDREN RECEIVED INTERFERON ALFA BY AEROSOLISATION TWICE A DAY, 14 (39%) RECEIVED LOPINAVIR-RITONAVIR SYRUP TWICE A DAY, AND SIX (17%) NEEDED OXYGEN INHALATION. MEAN TIME IN HOSPITAL WAS 14 (SD 3) DAYS. BY FEB 28, 2020, ALL PATIENTS WERE CURED. ALTHOUGH ALL PAEDIATRIC PATIENTS IN OUR COHORT HAD MILD OR MODERATE TYPE OF COVID-19, THE LARGE PROPORTION OF ASYMPTOMATIC CHILDREN INDICATES THE DIFFICULTY IN IDENTIFYING PAEDIATRIC PATIENTS WHO DO NOT HAVE CLEAR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL INFORMATION, LEADING TO A DANGEROUS SITUATION IN COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED INFECTIONS.

THE NUMBER OF AFFECTED PREGNANT WOMEN IS INCREASING, BUT SCARCE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ABOUT THE CLINICAL FEATURES OF COVID-19 IN PREGNANCY. THIS STUDY AIMED TO CLARIFY THE CLINICAL FEATURES AND OBSTETRIC AND NEONATAL OUTCOMES OF PREGNANT PATIENTS WITH COVID-19. IN THIS RETROSPECTIVE, SINGLE-CENTRE STUDY, WE INCLUDED ALL PREGNANT WOMEN WITH COVID-19 WHO WERE ADMITTED TO TONGJI HOSPITAL IN WUHAN, CHINA. CLINICAL FEATURES, TREATMENTS, AND MATERNAL AND FETAL OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED. SEVEN PATIENTS, ADMITTED TO TONGJI HOSPITAL FROM JAN 1, TO FEB 8, 2020, WERE INCLUDED IN OUR STUDY. THE MEAN AGE OF THE PATIENTS WAS 32 YEARS (RANGE 29-34 YEARS) AND THE MEAN GESTATIONAL AGE WAS 39 WEEKS PLUS 1 DAY (RANGE 37 WEEKS TO 41 WEEKS PLUS 2 DAYS). CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS WERE FEVER (SIX [86%] PATIENTS), COUGH (ONE [14%] PATIENT), SHORTNESS OF BREATH (ONE [14%] PATIENT), AND DIARRHOEA (ONE [14%] PATIENT). ALL THE PATIENTS HAD CAESAREAN SECTION WITHIN 3 DAYS OF CLINICAL PRESENTATION WITH AN AVERAGE GESTATIONAL AGE OF 39 WEEKS PLUS 2 DAYS. THE FINAL DATE OF FOLLOW-UP WAS FEB 12, 2020. THE OUTCOMES OF THE PREGNANT WOMEN AND NEONATES WERE GOOD. THREE NEONATES WERE TESTED FOR SARS-COV-2 AND ONE NEONATE WAS INFECTED WITH SARS-COV-2 36 H AFTER BIRTH. THE MATERNAL, FETAL, AND NEONATAL OUTCOMES OF PATIENTS WHO WERE INFECTED IN LATE PREGNANCY APPEARED VERY GOOD, AND THESE OUTCOMES WERE ACHIEVED WITH INTENSIVE, ACTIVE MANAGEMENT THAT MIGHT BE THE BEST PRACTICE IN THE ABSENCE OF MORE ROBUST DATA.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES","UNITED STATES","ENG","JOURNAL ARTICLE","","","","CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) CAUSES SEVERE COMMUNITY AND NOSOCOMIAL OUTBREAKS. COMPREHENSIVE DATA FOR SERIAL RESPIRATORY VIRAL LOAD AND SERUM ANTIBODY RESPONSES FROM PATIENTS INFECTED WITH SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS 2 (SARS-COV-2) ARE NOT YET AVAILABLE. NASOPHARYNGEAL AND THROAT SWABS ARE USUALLY OBTAINED FOR SERIAL VIRAL LOAD MONITORING OF RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS BUT GATHERING THESE SPECIMENS CAN CAUSE DISCOMFORT FOR PATIENTS AND PUT HEALTH-CARE WORKERS AT RISK. WE AIMED TO ASCERTAIN THE SERIAL RESPIRATORY VIRAL LOAD OF SARS-COV-2 IN POSTERIOR OROPHARYNGEAL (DEEP THROAT) SALIVA SAMPLES FROM PATIENTS WITH COVID-19, AND SERUM ANTIBODY RESPONSES. WE DID A COHORT STUDY AT TWO HOSPITALS IN HONG KONG. WE INCLUDED PATIENTS WITH LABORATORY-CONFIRMED COVID-19. WE OBTAINED SAMPLES OF BLOOD, URINE, POSTERIOR OROPHARYNGEAL SALIVA, AND RECTAL SWABS. SERIAL VIRAL LOAD WAS ASCERTAINED BY REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE QUANTITATIVE PCR (RT-QPCR). ANTIBODY LEVELS AGAINST THE SARS-COV-2 INTERNAL NUCLEOPROTEIN (NP) AND SURFACE SPIKE PROTEIN RECEPTOR BINDING DOMAIN (RBD) WERE MEASURED USING EIA. WHOLE-GENOME SEQUENCING WAS DONE TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE MUTATIONS ARISING DURING INFECTION. BETWEEN JAN 22, 2020, AND FEB 12, 2020, 30 PATIENTS WERE SCREENED FOR INCLUSION, OF WHOM 23 WERE INCLUDED (MEDIAN AGE 62 YEARS [RANGE 37-75]). THE MEDIAN VIRAL LOAD IN POSTERIOR OROPHARYNGEAL SALIVA OR OTHER RESPIRATORY SPECIMENS AT PRESENTATION WAS 5·2 LOG  COPIES PER ML (IQR 4·1-7·0). SALIVARY VIRAL LOAD WAS HIGHEST DURING THE FIRST WEEK AFTER SYMPTOM ONSET AND SUBSEQUENTLY DECLINED WITH TIME (SLOPE -0·15, 95% CI -0·19 TO -0·11; R =0·71). IN ONE PATIENT, VIRAL RNA WAS DETECTED 25 DAYS AFTER SYMPTOM ONSET. OLDER AGE WAS CORRELATED WITH HIGHER VIRAL LOAD (SPEARMAN'S Ρ=0·48, 95% CI 0·074-0·75; P=0·020). FOR 16 PATIENTS WITH SERUM SAMPLES AVAILABLE 14 DAYS OR LONGER AFTER SYMPTOM ONSET, RATES OF SEROPOSITIVITY WERE 94% FOR ANTI-NP IGG (N=15), 88% FOR ANTI-NP IGM (N=14), 100% FOR ANTI-RBD IGG (N=16), AND 94% FOR ANTI-RBD IGM (N=15). ANTI-SARS-COV-2-NP OR ANTI-SARS-COV-2-RBD IGG LEVELS CORRELATED WITH VIRUS NEUTRALISATION TITRE (R >0·9). NO GENOME MUTATIONS WERE DETECTED ON SERIAL SAMPLES. POSTERIOR OROPHARYNGEAL SALIVA SAMPLES ARE A NON-INVASIVE SPECIMEN MORE ACCEPTABLE TO PATIENTS AND HEALTH-CARE WORKERS. UNLIKE SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME, PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 HAD THE HIGHEST VIRAL LOAD NEAR PRESENTATION, WHICH COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE FAST-SPREADING NATURE OF THIS EPIDEMIC. THIS FINDING EMPHASISES THE IMPORTANCE OF STRINGENT INFECTION CONTROL AND EARLY USE OF POTENT ANTIVIRAL AGENTS, ALONE OR IN COMBINATION, FOR HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES","UNITED STATES","ENG","JOURNAL ARTICLE","","","","SINCE THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 OUTBREAK BEGAN IN THE CHINESE CITY OF WUHAN ON DEC 31, 2019, 68 IMPORTED CASES AND 175 LOCALLY ACQUIRED INFECTIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN SINGAPORE. WE AIMED TO INVESTIGATE OPTIONS FOR EARLY INTERVENTION IN SINGAPORE SHOULD LOCAL CONTAINMENT (EG, PREVENTING DISEASE SPREAD THROUGH CONTACT TRACING EFFORTS) BE UNSUCCESSFUL. WE ADAPTED AN INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC SIMULATION MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF HUMAN-TO-HUMAN TRANSMISSION OF SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS 2 (SARS-COV-2) IN A SIMULATED SINGAPOREAN POPULATION. USING THIS MODEL, WE ESTIMATED THE CUMULATIVE NUMBER OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTIONS AT 80 DAYS, AFTER DETECTION OF 100 CASES OF COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION, UNDER THREE INFECTIVITY SCENARIOS (BASIC REPRODUCTION NUMBER [R ] OF 1·5, 2·0, OR 2·5) AND ASSUMING 7·5% OF INFECTIONS ARE ASYMPTOMATIC. WE FIRST RAN THE MODEL ASSUMING NO INTERVENTION WAS IN PLACE (BASELINE SCENARIO), AND THEN ASSESSED THE EFFECT OF FOUR INTERVENTION SCENARIOS COMPARED WITH A BASELINE SCENARIO ON THE SIZE AND PROGRESSION OF THE OUTBREAK FOR EACH R  VALUE. THESE SCENARIOS INCLUDED ISOLATION MEASURES FOR INFECTED INDIVIDUALS AND QUARANTINING OF FAMILY MEMBERS (HEREAFTER REFERRED TO AS QUARANTINE); QUARANTINE PLUS SCHOOL CLOSURE; QUARANTINE PLUS WORKPLACE DISTANCING; AND QUARANTINE, SCHOOL CLOSURE, AND WORKPLACE DISTANCING (HEREAFTER REFERRED TO AS THE COMBINED INTERVENTION). WE ALSO DID SENSITIVITY ANALYSES BY ALTERING THE ASYMPTOMATIC FRACTION OF INFECTIONS (22·7%, 30·0%, 40·0%, AND 50·0%) TO COMPARE OUTBREAK SIZES UNDER THE SAME CONTROL MEASURES. FOR THE BASELINE SCENARIO, WHEN R  WAS 1·5, THE MEDIAN CUMULATIVE NUMBER OF INFECTIONS AT DAY 80 WAS 279 000 (IQR 245 000-320 000), CORRESPONDING TO 7·4% (IQR 6·5-8·5) OF THE RESIDENT POPULATION OF SINGAPORE. THE MEDIAN NUMBER OF INFECTIONS INCREASED WITH HIGHER INFECTIVITY: 727 000 CASES (670 000-776 000) WHEN R  WAS 2·0, CORRESPONDING TO 19·3% (17·8-20·6) OF THE SINGAPOREAN POPULATION, AND 1 207 000 CASES (1 164 000-1 249 000) WHEN R  WAS 2·5, CORRESPONDING TO 32% (30·9-33·1) OF THE SINGAPOREAN POPULATION. COMPARED WITH THE BASELINE SCENARIO, THE COMBINED INTERVENTION WAS THE MOST EFFECTIVE, REDUCING THE ESTIMATED MEDIAN NUMBER OF INFECTIONS BY 99·3% (IQR 92·6-99·9) WHEN R  WAS 1·5, BY 93·0% (81·5-99·7) WHEN R  WAS 2·0, AND BY 78·2% (59·0 -94·4) WHEN R  WAS 2·5. ASSUMING INCREASING ASYMPTOMATIC FRACTIONS UP TO 50·0%, UP TO 277 000 INFECTIONS WERE ESTIMATED TO OCCUR AT DAY 80 WITH THE COMBINED INTERVENTION RELATIVE TO 1800 FOR THE BASELINE AT R  OF 1·5. IMPLEMENTING THE COMBINED INTERVENTION OF QUARANTINING INFECTED INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS, WORKPLACE DISTANCING, AND SCHOOL CLOSURE ONCE COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN DETECTED COULD SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTIONS. WE THEREFORE RECOMMEND IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT OF THIS STRATEGY IF LOCAL SECONDARY TRANSMISSION IS CONFIRMED WITHIN SINGAPORE. HOWEVER, QUARANTINE AND WORKPLACE DISTANCING SHOULD BE PRIORITISED OVER SCHOOL CLOSURE BECAUSE AT THIS EARLY STAGE, SYMPTOMATIC CHILDREN HAVE HIGHER WITHDRAWAL RATES FROM SCHOOL THAN DO SYMPTOMATIC ADULTS FROM WORK. AT HIGHER ASYMPTOMATIC PROPORTIONS, INTERVENTION EFFECTIVENESS MIGHT BE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED REQUIRING THE NEED FOR EFFECTIVE CASE MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENTS, AND PREVENTIVE MEASURES SUCH AS VACCINES.

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL, CLINICAL DATA WERE ANALYZED BETWEEN THOSE WITH ABNORMAL OR NORMAL IMAGING FINDINGS. EXCLUDING 72 PATIENTS WITH NORMAL IMAGES, 230 OF 573 PATIENTS AFFECTED MORE THAN TWO LOBES. THE MEDIAN RADIOGRAPH SCORE WAS 2.0 AND THERE'S NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE SCORE AND OXYGENATION INDEX (Ρ=-0.657,P < 0.001). PATIENTS WITH ABNORMAL IMAGES WERE OLDER (46.65 ± 13.82), WITH HIGHER RATE OF COEXISTING CONDITION(28.8%), LOWER RATE OF EXPOSURE HISTORY AND LONGER TIME BETWEEN ONSET AND CONFIRMATION(5D) THAN NON-PNEUMONIA PATIENTS(ALL P < 0.05). HIGHER RATE OF FEVER, COUGH, EXPECTORATION, AND HEADACHE, LOWER LYMPHOCYTES, ALBUMIN, SERUM SODIUM LEVELS AND HIGHER TOTAL BILIRUBIN, CREATINE KINASE, LACTATE DEHYDROGENASE AND C-REACTIVE PROTEIN LEVELS AND LOWER OXYGENATION INDEX WERE OBSERVED IN PNEUMONIA PATIENTS (ALL P < 0.05). MUSCLE ACHE, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, NAUSEA AND VOMITING, LOWER LYMPHOCYTES LEVELS AND HIGHER SERUM CREATININE AND RADIOGRAPH SCORE AT ADMISSION WERE PREDICTIVE FACTORS FOR SEVERE/CRITICAL SUBTYPE.

WE EVALUATE THE ROLE OF HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE ON RESPIRATORY VIRAL LOADS. FRENCH CONFIRMED COVID-19 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN A SINGLE ARM PROTOCOL FROM EARLY MARCH TO MARCH 16 , TO RECEIVE 600MG OF HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE DAILY AND THEIR VIRAL LOAD IN NASOPHARYNGEAL SWABS WAS TESTED DAILY IN A HOSPITAL SETTING. DEPENDING ON THEIR CLINICAL PRESENTATION, AZITHROMYCIN WAS ADDED TO THE TREATMENT. UNTREATED PATIENTS FROM ANOTHER CENTER AND CASES REFUSING THE PROTOCOL WERE INCLUDED AS NEGATIVE CONTROLS. PRESENCE AND ABSENCE OF VIRUS AT DAY6-POST INCLUSION WAS CONSIDERED THE END POINT. SIX PATIENTS WERE ASYMPTOMATIC, 22 HAD UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTION SYMPTOMS AND EIGHT HAD LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTION SYMPTOMS. TWENTY CASES WERE TREATED IN THIS STUDY AND SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF THE VIRAL CARRIAGE AT D6-POST INCLUSION COMPARED TO CONTROLS, AND MUCH LOWER AVERAGE CARRYING DURATION THAN REPORTED OF UNTREATED PATIENTS IN THE LITERATURE. AZITHROMYCIN ADDED TO HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EFFICIENT FOR VIRUS ELIMINATION.

FURTHER ANALYSES DEMONSTRATE A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER PROPORTION OF REPORTED COVID-19 CASES WITHOUT TRAVEL HISTORY TO CHINA IN COUNTRIES WITH LOWER HAQ (HAQ I VS. HAQ II, POSTHOC P < 0.01). OUR DATA INDICATE THAT COUNTRIES WITH LOWER HAQ-INDEX MAY EITHER UNDERREPORT COVID-19 CASES OR ARE UNABLE TO ADEQUATELY DETECT THEM.

ENHANCED TCB IS AN EXPANSION OF THE TRADITIONAL TCB THAT PROVED HIGHLY EFFECTIVE DURING TAIWAN'S 2003 SARS OUTBREAK. TCB'S SUCCESS DERIVED FROM ENSURING THAT HEALTH CARE WORKERS (HCWS) AND PATIENTS WERE PROTECTED FROM FOMITE, CONTACT AND DROPLET TRANSMISSION WITHIN HOSPITALS. ALTHOUGH TCB PROVED SUCCESSFUL DURING SARS, ACHIEVING A SIMILAR LEVEL OF SUCCESS WITH THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK REQUIRES ADAPTING TCB TO THE UNIQUE MANIFESTATIONS OF THIS NEW DISEASE. THESE MANIFESTATIONS INCLUDE ASYMPTOMATIC INFECTION, A HYPER-AFFINITY TO ACE2 RECEPTORS RESULTING IN HIGH TRANSMISSIBILITY, FALSE NEGATIVES, AND AN INCUBATION PERIOD OF UP TO 22 DAYS. ENHANCED TCB INCORPORATES THE NECESSARY ADAPTATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, ETCB INCLUDES EXPANDING THE TCB TRANSITION ZONE TO INCORPORATE A NEW SECTOR - THE QUARANTINE WARD. THIS WARD HOUSES PATIENTS EXHIBITING ATYPICAL MANIFESTATIONS OR AWAITING DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS. A SECOND ADAPTATION INVOLVES ENHANCING THE CHECKPOINT HAND DISINFECTION AND GOWNING UP WITH PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT DEPLOYED IN TRADITIONAL TCB. UNDER ETCB, CHECKPOINT HAND DISINFECTION AND DONNING OF FACE MASKS ARE NOW REQUIRED OF ALL VISITORS WHO SEEK TO ENTER HOSPITALS. THESE ENHANCEMENTS ENSURE THAT TRANSMISSIONS BY DROPLETS, FOMITES AND CONTACT ARE DISRUPTED BOTH WITHIN HOSPITALS AND BETWEEN HOSPITALS AND THE BROADER COMMUNITY.

THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 INFECTION WHO MIGHT DEVELOP SEVERE ARDS THAT IS REFRACTORY TO MAXIMAL MEDICAL MANAGEMENT AND REQUIRE THIS LEVEL OF SUPPORT IS CURRENTLY UNKNOWN. AVAILABLE EVIDENCE FROM SIMILAR PATIENT POPULATIONS SUGGESTS THAT CAREFULLY SELECTED PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ARDS WHO DO NOT BENEFIT FROM CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT MIGHT BE SUCCESSFULLY SUPPORTED WITH VENOVENOUS ECMO. THE NEED FOR ECMO IS RELATIVELY LOW AND ITS USE IS MOSTLY RESTRICTED TO SPECIALISED CENTRES GLOBALLY. PROVIDING COMPLEX THERAPIES SUCH AS ECMO DURING OUTBREAKS OF EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES HAS UNIQUE CHALLENGES. CAREFUL PLANNING, JUDICIOUS RESOURCE ALLOCATION, AND TRAINING OF PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE COMPLEX THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS WHILE ADHERING TO STRICT INFECTION CONTROL MEASURES ARE ALL CRUCIAL COMPONENTS OF AN ECMO ACTION PLAN. ECMO CAN BE INITIATED IN SPECIALIST CENTRES, OR PATIENTS CAN RECEIVE ECMO DURING TRANSPORTATION FROM A CENTRE THAT IS NOT SPECIALISED FOR THIS PROCEDURE TO AN EXPERT ECMO CENTRE. ENSURING THAT SYSTEMS ENABLE SAFE AND COORDINATED MOVEMENT OF CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS, STAFF, AND EQUIPMENT IS IMPORTANT TO IMPROVE ECMO ACCESS.

SO FAR, COVID-19 HAS AFFECTED 85 403 PATIENTS IN 57 COUNTRIES/TERRITORIES AND HAS CAUSED 2924 DEATHS IN 9 COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA DIFFER BETWEEN COUNTRIES. ALTHOUGH CHINA HAD HIGHER MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY THAN OTHER SITES, THE NUMBER OF NEW DAILY CASES IN CHINA HAS BEEN LOWER THAN OUTSIDE OF CHINA SINCE 26 FEBRUARY 2020. THE INCIDENCE RANGED FROM 61.44 PER 1 000 000 PEOPLE IN THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA TO 0.0002 PER 1 000 000 PEOPLE IN INDIA. THE DAILY CUMULATIVE INDEX (DCI) OF COVID-19 (CUMULATIVE CASES/NO.

HOWEVER, THE DCIS IN OTHER COUNTRIES/TERRITORIES WERE <10 PER DAY. SEVERAL EFFECTIVE MEASURES INCLUDING RESTRICTING TRAVEL FROM CHINA, CONTROLLING THE DISTRIBUTION OF MASKS, EXTENSIVE INVESTIGATION OF COVID-19 SPREAD, AND ONCE-DAILY PRESS CONFERENCES BY THE GOVERNMENT TO INFORM AND EDUCATE PEOPLE WERE AGGRESSIVELY CONDUCTED IN TAIWAN. THIS IS PROBABLY THE REASON WHY THERE WAS ONLY 39 CASES (AS OF 29 FEBRUARY 2020) WITH A DCI OF 1 CASE PER DAY IN TAIWAN, WHICH IS MUCH LOWER THAN THAT OF NEARBY COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA AND JAPAN. IN ADDITION, THE INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY WERE CORRELATED WITH THE DCI.

IN LIGHT OF THE OUTBREAK OF 2019 NOVEL CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19), WE AIMED TO REVIEW EXISTING HEALTH SECURITY CAPACITIES AGAINST PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS AND EVENTS. WE USED 18 INDICATORS FROM THE IHR STATE PARTY ANNUAL REPORTING (SPAR) TOOL AND ASSOCIATED DATA FROM NATIONAL SPAR REPORTS TO DEVELOP FIVE INDICES: (1) PREVENT, (2) DETECT, (3) RESPOND, (4) ENABLING FUNCTION, AND (5) OPERATIONAL READINESS. WE USED SPAR 2018 DATA FOR ALL OF THE INDICATORS AND CATEGORISED COUNTRIES INTO FIVE LEVELS ACROSS THE INDICES, IN WHICH LEVEL 1 INDICATED THE LOWEST LEVEL OF NATIONAL CAPACITY AND LEVEL 5 THE HIGHEST. WE ALSO ANALYSED DATA AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL (USING THE SIX GEOGRAPHICAL WHO REGIONS). OF 182 COUNTRIES, 52 (28%) HAD PREVENT CAPACITIES AT LEVELS 1 OR 2, AND 60 (33%) HAD RESPONSE CAPACITIES AT LEVELS 1 OR 2. 81 (45%) COUNTRIES HAD PREVENT CAPACITIES AND 78 (43%) HAD RESPONSE CAPACITIES AT LEVELS 4 OR 5, INDICATING THAT THESE COUNTRIES WERE OPERATIONALLY READY. 138 (76%) COUNTRIES SCORED MORE HIGHLY IN THE DETECT INDEX THAN IN THE OTHER INDICES. 44 (24%) COUNTRIES DID NOT HAVE AN EFFECTIVE ENABLING FUNCTION FOR PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS AND EVENTS, INCLUDING INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAKS (7 [4%] AT LEVEL 1 AND 37 [20%] AT LEVEL 2). 102 (56%) COUNTRIES HAD LEVEL 4 OR LEVEL 5 ENABLING FUNCTION CAPACITIES IN PLACE. 32 (18%) COUNTRIES HAD LOW READINESS (2 [1%] AT LEVEL 1 AND 30 [17%] AT LEVEL 2), AND 104 (57%) COUNTRIES WERE OPERATIONALLY READY TO PREVENT, DETECT, AND CONTROL AN OUTBREAK OF A NOVEL INFECTIOUS DISEASE (66 [36%] AT LEVEL 4 AND 38 [21%] AT LEVEL 5). COUNTRIES VARY WIDELY IN TERMS OF THEIR CAPACITY TO PREVENT, DETECT, AND RESPOND TO OUTBREAKS. HALF OF ALL COUNTRIES ANALYSED HAVE STRONG OPERATIONAL READINESS CAPACITIES IN PLACE, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT AN EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO POTENTIAL HEALTH EMERGENCIES COULD BE ENABLED, INCLUDING TO COVID-19.

THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO PROVIDE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WITH A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THIS NEW INFECTIOUS DISEASE. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL, CLINICAL FEATURES, LABORATORY FINDINGS, RADIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS, TREATMENT, AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES OF 135 PATIENTS IN NORTHEAST CHONGQING WERE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED IN THIS STUDY. A TOTAL OF 135 HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 WERE ENROLLED. THE MEDIAN AGE WAS 47 YEARS (INTERQUARTILE RANGE, 36-55), AND THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT GENDER DIFFERENCE (53.3% MEN). THE MAJORITY OF PATIENTS HAD CONTACT WITH PEOPLE FROM THE WUHAN AREA. FORTY-THREE (31.9%) PATIENTS HAD UNDERLYING DISEASE, PRIMARILY HYPERTENSION (13 [9.6%]), DIABETES (12 [8.9%]), CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (7 [5.2%]), AND MALIGNANCY (4 [3.0%]). COMMON SYMPTOMS INCLUDED FEVER (120 [88.9%]), COUGH (102 [76.5%]), AND FATIGUE (44 [32.5%]). CHEST COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SCANS SHOWED BILATERAL PATCHY SHADOWS OR GROUND GLASS OPACITY IN THE LUNGS OF ALL THE PATIENTS. ALL PATIENTS RECEIVED ANTIVIRAL THERAPY (135 [100%]) (KALETRA AND INTERFERON WERE BOTH USED), ANTIBACTERIAL THERAPY (59 [43.7%]), AND CORTICOSTEROIDS (36 [26.7%]). IN ADDITION, MANY PATIENTS RECEIVED TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE (TCM) (124 [91.8%]). IT IS SUGGESTED THAT PATIENTS SHOULD RECEIVE KALETRA EARLY AND SHOULD BE TREATED BY A COMBINATION OF WESTERN AND CHINESE MEDICINES. COMPARED TO THE MILD CASES, THE SEVERE ONES HAD LOWER LYMPHOCYTE COUNTS AND HIGHER PLASMA LEVELS OF PT, APTT, D-DIMER, LACTATE DEHYDROGENASE, PCT, ALB, C-REACTIVE PROTEIN, AND ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THE CLINIC FEATURES AND THERAPIES OF 135 COVID-19 PATIENTS. KALETRA AND TCM PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE TREATMENT OF THE VIRAL PNEUMONIA.

TO EXAMINE THE GROWTH RATE OF THE OUTBREAK, WE PRESENT THE FIRST STUDY TO REPORT THE REPRODUCTION NUMBER OF COVID-19 IN SOUTH KOREA. THE DAILY CONFIRMED CASES OF COVID-19 IN SOUTH KOREA WERE EXTRACTED FROM PUBLICLY AVAILABLE SOURCES. BY USING THE EMPIRICAL REPORTING DELAY DISTRIBUTION AND SIMULATING THE GENERALIZED GROWTH MODEL, WE ESTIMATED THE EFFECTIVE REPRODUCTION NUMBER BASED ON THE DISCRETIZED PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF THE GENERATION INTERVAL. WE IDENTIFIED FOUR MAJOR CLUSTERS AND ESTIMATED THE REPRODUCTION NUMBER AT 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6). IN ADDITION, THE INTRINSIC GROWTH RATE WAS ESTIMATED AT 0.6 (95% CI: 0.6, 0.7), AND THE SCALING OF GROWTH PARAMETER WAS ESTIMATED AT 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8), INDICATING SUB-EXPONENTIAL GROWTH DYNAMICS OF COVID-19.

SINCE THEN THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS PNEUMONIA DISEASE HAS BEEN SPREADING QUICKLY AND MANY COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES HAVE BEEN AFFECTED, WITH MAJOR OUTBREAKS IN CHINA, SOUTH KOREA, ITALY, AND IRAN. INFLUENZA VIRUS HAS BEEN KNOWN AS A COMMON PATHOGEN IN WINTER AND IT CAN CAUSE PNEUMONIA. IT WAS FOUND CLINICALLY THAT VERY FEW PATIENTS WERE DIAGNOSED WITH BOTH COVID-19 AND INFLUENZA VIRUS. A TOTAL OF 5 OF THE 115 PATIENTS CONFIRMED WITH COVID-19 WERE ALSO DIAGNOSED WITH INFLUENZA VIRUS INFECTION, WITH THREE CASES BEING INFLUENZA A AND TWO CASES BEING INFLUENZA B. IN THIS STUDY, WE DESCRIBE THE CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THOSE PATIENTS WHO GOT INFECTED WITH COVID-19 AS WELL AS INFLUENZA VIRUS. COMMON SYMPTOMS AT ONSET OF ILLNESS INCLUDED FEVER (FIVE [100%] PATIENTS), COUGH (FIVE [100%] PATIENTS), SHORTNESS OF BREATH (FIVE [100%] PATIENTS), NASAL TAMPON (THREE [60%] PATIENTS), PHARYNGALGIA (THREE [60%] PATIENTS), MYALGIA (TWO [40%] PATIENTS), FATIGUE (TWO [40%] PATIENTS), HEADACHE (TWO [40%] PATIENTS), AND EXPECTORATION (TWO [40%] PATIENTS). THE LABORATORY RESULTS SHOWED THAT COMPARED TO THE NORMAL VALUES, THE PATIENTS' LYMPHOCYTES WERE REDUCED (FOUR [80%] PATIENTS), AND LIVER FUNCTIONS ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE AND ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE (TWO [40%] PATIENTS AND TWO [40%] PATIENTS) AND C-REACTIVE PROTEIN (FOUR [80%] PATIENTS) WERE INCREASED WHEN ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL. THEY STAYED IN THE HOSPITAL FOR 14, 30, 17, 12, AND 19 DAYS (28.4 ± 7.02), RESPECTIVELY. THE MAIN COMPLICATIONS FOR THE PATIENTS WERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ONE [20%] PATIENTS), ACUTE LIVER INJURY (THREE [60%] PATIENTS), AND DIARRHEA (TWO [40%] PATIENTS). ALL PATIENTS WERE GIVEN ANTIVIRAL THERAPY (INCLUDING OSELTAMIVIR), OXYGEN INHALATION, AND ANTIBIOTICS. THREE PATIENTS WERE TREATED WITH GLUCOCORTICOIDS INCLUDING TWO TREATED WITH ORAL GLUCOCORTICOIDS. ONE OF THE FIVE PATIENTS HAD TRANSIENT HEMOSTATIC MEDICATION FOR HEMOPTYSIS. FORTUNATELY, ALL PATIENTS DID NOT NEED INTENSIVE CARE UNIT AND WERE DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL WITHOUT DEATH. IN CONCLUSION, THOSE PATIENTS WITH BOTH COVID-19 AND INFLUENZA VIRUS INFECTION DID NOT APPEAR TO SHOW A MORE SEVERE CONDITION BECAUSE BASED ON THE LABORATORY FINDINGS, IMAGING STUDIES, AND PATIENT PROGNOSIS, THEY SHOWED SIMILAR CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS AS THOSE PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 INFECTION ONLY. HOWEVER, IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE SYMPTOMS OF NASAL TAMPON AND PHARYNGALGIA MAY BE MORE PRONE TO APPEAR FOR THOSE COINFECTION PATIENTS.","DEPARTMENT OF GASTROENTEROLOGY, TONGJI HOSPITAL, TONGJI MEDICAL COLLEGE, HUAZHONG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, WUHAN, HUBEI, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF GASTROENTEROLOGY, TONGJI HOSPITAL, TONGJI MEDICAL COLLEGE, HUAZHONG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, WUHAN, HUBEI, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF GASTROENTEROLOGY, TONGJI HOSPITAL, TONGJI MEDICAL COLLEGE, HUAZHONG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, WUHAN, HUBEI, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF GASTROENTEROLOGY, INTERNAL MEDICINE II, KLINIKUM RECHTS DER ISAR, TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF MUNICH (TUM), MUNICH, GERMANY.;DEPARTMENT OF GASTROENTEROLOGY, TONGJI HOSPITAL, TONGJI MEDICAL COLLEGE, HUAZHONG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, WUHAN, HUBEI, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF GASTROENTEROLOGY, TONGJI HOSPITAL, TONGJI MEDICAL COLLEGE, HUAZHONG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, WUHAN, HUBEI, CHINA.","NA",0,"1096-9071","J.

AS OF FEB 15, 2020, 36 CASES OF COVID-19 WERE LINKED EPIDEMIOLOGICALLY TO THE FIRST THREE CLUSTERS OF CIRCUMSCRIBED LOCAL TRANSMISSION IN SINGAPORE. 425 CLOSE CONTACTS WERE QUARANTINED. DIRECT OR PROLONGED CLOSE CONTACT WAS REPORTED AMONG AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS, ALTHOUGH INDIRECT TRANSMISSION (EG, VIA FOMITES AND SHARED FOOD) COULD NOT BE EXCLUDED. THE MEDIAN INCUBATION PERIOD OF SARS-COV-2 WAS 4 DAYS (IQR 3-6). THE SERIAL INTERVAL BETWEEN TRANSMISSION PAIRS RANGED BETWEEN 3 DAYS AND 8 DAYS. SARS-COV-2 IS TRANSMISSIBLE IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS, AND LOCAL CLUSTERS OF COVID-19 ARE EXPECTED IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGH TRAVEL VOLUME FROM CHINA BEFORE THE LOCKDOWN OF WUHAN AND INSTITUTION OF TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS. ENHANCED SURVEILLANCE AND CONTACT TRACING IS ESSENTIAL TO MINIMISE THE RISK OF WIDESPREAD TRANSMISSION IN THE COMMUNITY.

IN SEVERE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS PNEUMONIA CASES, THE NUMBER OF PLATELETS, THEIR DYNAMIC CHANGES DURING THE TREATMENT, PLATELET-TO-LYMPHOCYTE RATIO (PLR) WERE A CONCERN. WE SOUGHT TO DESCRIBE THE PLATELET FEATURE OF THESE CASES. SINGLE-CENTER CASE SERIES OF THE 30 HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS WITH CONFIRMED CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID)-19 IN HUIZHOU MUNICIPAL CENTRAL HOSPITAL FROM JANUARY 2020 TO FEBRUARY 2020 WERE RETROSPECTIVELY ANALYZED. DEMOGRAPHIC, CLINICAL, BLOOD ROUTINE RESULTS, OTHER LABORATORY RESULTS, AND TREATMENT DATA WERE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED. OUTCOMES OF SEVERE PATIENTS AND NONSEVERE PATIENTS WERE COMPARED. UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT: AGE, PLATELET PEAKS, AND PLR AT PEAK PLATELET WERE THE INFLUENCING FACTORS IN SEVERE PATIENTS, MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE PLR VALUE AT PEAK PLATELET DURING TREATMENT WAS AN INDEPENDENT INFLUENCING FACTOR IN SEVERE PATIENTS. THE AVERAGE HOSPITALIZATION DAY OF PATIENTS WITH PLATELET PEAKS DURING TREATMENT WAS LONGER THAN THOSE WITHOUT PLATELET PEAKS (P < .05). THE AVERAGE AGE OF PATIENTS WITH PLATELET PEAKS DURING TREATMENT WAS OLDER THAN THOSE WITHOUT PLATELET PEAKS (P < .05).

CLINICAL, LABORATORY, AND IMAGING FEATURES HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY CHARACTERIZED IN SOME OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES. NO SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS ON COVID-19 HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED TO DATE. WE PERFORMED A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW WITH META-ANALYSIS, USING THREE DATABASES TO ASSESS CLINICAL, LABORATORY, IMAGING FEATURES, AND OUTCOMES OF COVID-19 CONFIRMED CASES. OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES AND ALSO CASE REPORTS, WERE INCLUDED, AND ANALYZED SEPARATELY. WE PERFORMED A RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL META-ANALYSIS TO CALCULATE POOLED PREVALENCES AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (95%CI). 660 ARTICLES WERE RETRIEVED FOR THE TIME FRAME (1/1/2020-2/23/2020). AFTER SCREENING, 27 ARTICLES WERE SELECTED FOR FULL-TEXT ASSESSMENT, 19 BEING FINALLY INCLUDED FOR QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES. ADDITIONALLY, 39 CASE REPORT ARTICLES WERE INCLUDED AND ANALYZED SEPARATELY. FOR 656 PATIENTS, FEVER (88.7%, 95%CI 84.5-92.9%), COUGH (57.6%, 95%CI 40.8-74.4%) AND DYSPNEA (45.6%, 95%CI 10.9-80.4%) WERE THE MOST PREVALENT MANIFESTATIONS. AMONG THE PATIENTS, 20.3% (95%CI 10.0-30.6%) REQUIRED INTENSIVE CARE UNIT (ICU), 32.8% PRESENTED WITH ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS) (95%CI 13.7-51.8), 6.2% (95%CI 3.1-9.3) WITH SHOCK. SOME 13.9% (95%CI 6.2-21.5%) OF HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS HAD FATAL OUTCOMES (CASE FATALITY RATE, CFR). COVID-19 BRINGS A HUGE BURDEN TO HEALTHCARE FACILITIES, ESPECIALLY IN PATIENTS WITH COMORBIDITIES. ICU WAS REQUIRED FOR APPROXIMATELY 20% OF POLYMORBID, COVID-19 INFECTED PATIENTS AND HOSPITALIZATION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A CFR OF >13%.

A GLOBAL RESPONSE TO PREPARE HEALTH SYSTEMS WORLDWIDE IS IMPERATIVE. ALTHOUGH CONTAINMENT MEASURES IN CHINA HAVE REDUCED NEW CASES BY MORE THAN 90%, THIS REDUCTION IS NOT THE CASE ELSEWHERE, AND ITALY HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY AFFECTED. THERE IS NOW GRAVE CONCERN REGARDING THE ITALIAN NATIONAL HEALTH SYSTEM'S CAPACITY TO EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS WHO ARE INFECTED AND REQUIRE INTENSIVE CARE FOR SARS-COV-2 PNEUMONIA. THE PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS IN INTENSIVE CARE REPORTED DAILY IN ITALY BETWEEN MARCH 1 AND MARCH 11, 2020, HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN BETWEEN 9% AND 11% OF PATIENTS WHO ARE ACTIVELY INFECTED. THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS INFECTED SINCE FEB 21 IN ITALY CLOSELY FOLLOWS AN EXPONENTIAL TREND. IF THIS TREND CONTINUES FOR 1 MORE WEEK, THERE WILL BE 30 000 INFECTED PATIENTS. INTENSIVE CARE UNITS WILL THEN BE AT MAXIMUM CAPACITY; UP TO 4000 HOSPITAL BEDS WILL BE NEEDED BY MID-APRIL, 2020. OUR ANALYSIS MIGHT HELP POLITICAL LEADERS AND HEALTH AUTHORITIES TO ALLOCATE ENOUGH RESOURCES, INCLUDING PERSONNEL, BEDS, AND INTENSIVE CARE FACILITIES, TO MANAGE THE SITUATION IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND WEEKS. IF THE ITALIAN OUTBREAK FOLLOWS A SIMILAR TREND AS IN HUBEI PROVINCE, CHINA, THE NUMBER OF NEWLY INFECTED PATIENTS COULD START TO DECREASE WITHIN 3-4 DAYS, DEPARTING FROM THE EXPONENTIAL TREND. HOWEVER, THIS CANNOT CURRENTLY BE PREDICTED BECAUSE OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES AND THE CAPACITY TO QUICKLY BUILD DEDICATED FACILITIES IN CHINA.","DEPARTMENT OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION AND PRODUCTION ENGINEERING, UNIVERSITY OF BERGAMO, DALMINE;ISTITUTO DI RICERCHE FARMACOLOGICHE MARIO NEGRI IRCCS.","NA",0,"1474-547X","LANCET","LANCET",2020,"2020",NA,"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30627-9",NA,"","","32178769","32178769","PUBMED","DEPARTMENT OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION AND PRODUCTION ENGINEERING, UNIVERSITY OF BERGAMO, DALMINE;ISTITUTO DI RICERCHE FARMACOLOGICHE MARIO NEGRI IRCCS.","NA","NA"

ONE WEEK LATER, SHE WAS HOSPITALISED WITH PNEUMONIA AND TESTED POSITIVE FOR SARS-COV-2. HER HUSBAND (PATIENT 2) DID NOT TRAVEL BUT HAD FREQUENT CLOSE CONTACT WITH HIS WIFE. HE WAS ADMITTED 8 DAYS LATER AND TESTED POSITIVE FOR SARS-COV-2. OVERALL, 372 CONTACTS OF BOTH CASES WERE IDENTIFIED; 347 UNDERWENT ACTIVE SYMPTOM MONITORING, INCLUDING 152 COMMUNITY CONTACTS AND 195 HEALTH-CARE PERSONNEL. OF MONITORED CONTACTS, 43 BECAME PERSONS UNDER INVESTIGATION, IN ADDITION TO PATIENT 2. THESE 43 PERSONS UNDER INVESTIGATION AND ALL 32 ASYMPTOMATIC HEALTH-CARE PERSONNEL TESTED NEGATIVE FOR SARS-COV-2.

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 HAVE BEEN REPORTED BUT RISK FACTORS FOR MORTALITY AND A DETAILED CLINICAL COURSE OF ILLNESS, INCLUDING VIRAL SHEDDING, HAVE NOT BEEN WELL DESCRIBED. IN THIS RETROSPECTIVE, MULTICENTRE COHORT STUDY, WE INCLUDED ALL ADULT INPATIENTS (≥18 YEARS OLD) WITH LABORATORY-CONFIRMED COVID-19 FROM JINYINTAN HOSPITAL AND WUHAN PULMONARY HOSPITAL (WUHAN, CHINA) WHO HAD BEEN DISCHARGED OR HAD DIED BY JAN 31, 2020. DEMOGRAPHIC, CLINICAL, TREATMENT, AND LABORATORY DATA, INCLUDING SERIAL SAMPLES FOR VIRAL RNA DETECTION, WERE EXTRACTED FROM ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS AND COMPARED BETWEEN SURVIVORS AND NON-SURVIVORS. WE USED UNIVARIABLE AND MULTIVARIABLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION METHODS TO EXPLORE THE RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH IN-HOSPITAL DEATH. 191 PATIENTS (135 FROM JINYINTAN HOSPITAL AND 56 FROM WUHAN PULMONARY HOSPITAL) WERE INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY, OF WHOM 137 WERE DISCHARGED AND 54 DIED IN HOSPITAL. 91 (48%) PATIENTS HAD A COMORBIDITY, WITH HYPERTENSION BEING THE MOST COMMON (58 [30%] PATIENTS), FOLLOWED BY DIABETES (36 [19%] PATIENTS) AND CORONARY HEART DISEASE (15 [8%] PATIENTS). MULTIVARIABLE REGRESSION SHOWED INCREASING ODDS OF IN-HOSPITAL DEATH ASSOCIATED WITH OLDER AGE (ODDS RATIO 1·10, 95% CI 1·03-1·17, PER YEAR INCREASE; P=0·0043), HIGHER SEQUENTIAL ORGAN FAILURE ASSESSMENT (SOFA) SCORE (5·65, 2·61-12·23; P<0·0001), AND D-DIMER GREATER THAN 1 ΜG/ML (18·42, 2·64-128·55; P=0·0033) ON ADMISSION. MEDIAN DURATION OF VIRAL SHEDDING WAS 20·0 DAYS (IQR 17·0-24·0) IN SURVIVORS, BUT SARS-COV-2 WAS DETECTABLE UNTIL DEATH IN NON-SURVIVORS. THE LONGEST OBSERVED DURATION OF VIRAL SHEDDING IN SURVIVORS WAS 37 DAYS. THE POTENTIAL RISK FACTORS OF OLDER AGE, HIGH SOFA SCORE, AND D-DIMER GREATER THAN 1 ΜG/ML COULD HELP CLINICIANS TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS WITH POOR PROGNOSIS AT AN EARLY STAGE. PROLONGED VIRAL SHEDDING PROVIDES THE RATIONALE FOR A STRATEGY OF ISOLATION OF INFECTED PATIENTS AND OPTIMAL ANTIVIRAL INTERVENTIONS IN THE FUTURE.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES","UNITED STATES","ENG","JOURNAL ARTICLE","","","","AN OUTBREAK OF SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS 2 (SARS-COV-2) HAS LED TO 95 333 CONFIRMED CASES AS OF MARCH 5, 2020. UNDERSTANDING THE EARLY TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS OF THE INFECTION AND EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROL MEASURES IS CRUCIAL FOR ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL FOR SUSTAINED TRANSMISSION TO OCCUR IN NEW AREAS. COMBINING A MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF SEVERE SARS-COV-2 TRANSMISSION WITH FOUR DATASETS FROM WITHIN AND OUTSIDE WUHAN, WE ESTIMATED HOW TRANSMISSION IN WUHAN VARIED BETWEEN DECEMBER, 2019, AND FEBRUARY, 2020. WE USED THESE ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL FOR SUSTAINED HUMAN-TO-HUMAN TRANSMISSION TO OCCUR IN LOCATIONS OUTSIDE WUHAN IF CASES WERE INTRODUCED. WE COMBINED A STOCHASTIC TRANSMISSION MODEL WITH DATA ON CASES OF CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) IN WUHAN AND INTERNATIONAL CASES THAT ORIGINATED IN WUHAN TO ESTIMATE HOW TRANSMISSION HAD VARIED OVER TIME DURING JANUARY, 2020, AND FEBRUARY, 2020. BASED ON THESE ESTIMATES, WE THEN CALCULATED THE PROBABILITY THAT NEWLY INTRODUCED CASES MIGHT GENERATE OUTBREAKS IN OTHER AREAS. TO ESTIMATE THE EARLY DYNAMICS OF TRANSMISSION IN WUHAN, WE FITTED A STOCHASTIC TRANSMISSION DYNAMIC MODEL TO MULTIPLE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATASETS ON CASES IN WUHAN AND INTERNATIONALLY EXPORTED CASES FROM WUHAN. THE FOUR DATASETS WE FITTED TO WERE: DAILY NUMBER OF NEW INTERNATIONALLY EXPORTED CASES (OR LACK THEREOF), BY DATE OF ONSET, AS OF JAN 26, 2020; DAILY NUMBER OF NEW CASES IN WUHAN WITH NO MARKET EXPOSURE, BY DATE OF ONSET, BETWEEN DEC 1, 2019, AND JAN 1, 2020; DAILY NUMBER OF NEW CASES IN CHINA, BY DATE OF ONSET, BETWEEN DEC 29, 2019, AND JAN 23, 2020; AND PROPORTION OF INFECTED PASSENGERS ON EVACUATION FLIGHTS BETWEEN JAN 29, 2020, AND FEB 4, 2020. WE USED AN ADDITIONAL TWO DATASETS FOR COMPARISON WITH MODEL OUTPUTS: DAILY NUMBER OF NEW EXPORTED CASES FROM WUHAN (OR LACK THEREOF) IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGH CONNECTIVITY TO WUHAN (IE, TOP 20 MOST AT-RISK COUNTRIES), BY DATE OF CONFIRMATION, AS OF FEB 10, 2020; AND DATA ON NEW CONFIRMED CASES REPORTED IN WUHAN BETWEEN JAN 16, 2020, AND FEB 11, 2020. WE ESTIMATED THAT THE MEDIAN DAILY REPRODUCTION NUMBER (R ) IN WUHAN DECLINED FROM 2·35 (95% CI 1·15-4·77) 1 WEEK BEFORE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS WERE INTRODUCED ON JAN 23, 2020, TO 1·05 (0·41-2·39) 1 WEEK AFTER. BASED ON OUR ESTIMATES OF R , ASSUMING SARS-LIKE VARIATION, WE CALCULATED THAT IN LOCATIONS WITH SIMILAR TRANSMISSION POTENTIAL TO WUHAN IN EARLY JANUARY, ONCE THERE ARE AT LEAST FOUR INDEPENDENTLY INTRODUCED CASES, THERE IS A MORE THAN 50% CHANCE THE INFECTION WILL ESTABLISH WITHIN THAT POPULATION. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT COVID-19 TRANSMISSION PROBABLY DECLINED IN WUHAN DURING LATE JANUARY, 2020, COINCIDING WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF TRAVEL CONTROL MEASURES. AS MORE CASES ARRIVE IN INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS WITH SIMILAR TRANSMISSION POTENTIAL TO WUHAN BEFORE THESE CONTROL MEASURES, IT IS LIKELY MANY CHAINS OF TRANSMISSION WILL FAIL TO ESTABLISH INITIALLY, BUT MIGHT LEAD TO NEW OUTBREAKS EVENTUALLY.

A NEW CORONAVIRUS, NAMED SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS 2 (SARS-COV-2) BY THE CORONAVIRUS STUDY GROUP OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE ON TAXONOMY OF VIRUSES WAS SOON FOUND TO BE THE CAUSE. AT PRESENT, THE SENSITIVITY OF CLINICAL NUCLEIC ACID DETECTION IS LIMITED, AND IT IS STILL UNCLEAR WHETHER IT IS RELATED TO GENETIC VARIATION. IN THIS STUDY, WE RETRIEVED 95 FULL-LENGTH GENOMIC SEQUENCES OF SARAS-COV-2 STRAINS FROM THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY INFORMATION AND GISAID DATABASES, ESTABLISHED THE REFERENCE SEQUENCE BY CONDUCTING MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT AND PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES, AND ANALYZED SEQUENCE VARIATIONS ALONG THE SARS-COV-2 GENOME. THE HOMOLOGY AMONG ALL VIRAL STRAINS WAS GENERALLY HIGH, AMONG THEM, 99.99% (99.91%-100%) AT THE NUCLEOTIDE LEVEL AND 99.99% (99.79%-100%) AT THE AMINO ACID LEVEL. ALTHOUGH OVERALL VARIATION IN OPEN-READING FRAME (ORF) REGIONS IS LOW, 13 VARIATION SITES IN 1A, 1B, S, 3A, M, 8, AND N REGIONS WERE IDENTIFIED, AMONG WHICH POSITIONS NT28144 IN ORF 8 AND NT8782 IN ORF 1A SHOWED MUTATION RATE OF 30.53% (29/95) AND 29.47% (28/95), RESPECTIVELY. THESE FINDINGS SUGGESTED THAT THERE MAY BE SELECTIVE MUTATIONS IN SARS-COV-2, AND IT IS NECESSARY TO AVOID CERTAIN REGIONS WHEN DESIGNING PRIMERS AND PROBES. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE REFERENCE SEQUENCE FOR SARS-COV-2 COULD BENEFIT NOT ONLY BIOLOGICAL STUDY OF THIS VIRUS BUT ALSO DIAGNOSIS, CLINICAL MONITORING AND INTERVENTION OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTION IN THE FUTURE.","DEPARTMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES, THE SECOND HOSPITAL OF ANHUI MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, HEFEI, CHINA.;INSTITUTE OF CLINICAL VIROLOGY, THE SECOND HOSPITAL OF ANHUI MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, HEFEI, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES, THE AFFILIATED ANQING HOSPITAL OF ANHUI MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, ANQING, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES, THE SECOND HOSPITAL OF ANHUI MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, HEFEI, CHINA.;INSTITUTE OF CLINICAL VIROLOGY, THE SECOND HOSPITAL OF ANHUI MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, HEFEI, CHINA.;INSTITUTE OF CLINICAL VIROLOGY, THE SECOND HOSPITAL OF ANHUI MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, HEFEI, CHINA.;INSTITUTE OF CLINICAL VIROLOGY, THE SECOND HOSPITAL OF ANHUI MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, HEFEI, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES, THE SECOND HOSPITAL OF ANHUI MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, HEFEI, CHINA.;INSTITUTE OF CLINICAL VIROLOGY, THE SECOND HOSPITAL OF ANHUI MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, HEFEI, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES, THE SECOND HOSPITAL OF ANHUI MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, HEFEI, CHINA.;INSTITUTE OF CLINICAL VIROLOGY, THE SECOND HOSPITAL OF ANHUI MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, HEFEI, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES, THE SECOND HOSPITAL OF ANHUI MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, HEFEI, CHINA.;INSTITUTE OF CLINICAL VIROLOGY, THE SECOND HOSPITAL OF ANHUI MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, HEFEI, CHINA.;ANHUI PROVINCIAL LABORATORY OF INFLAMMATORY AND IMMUNITY DISEASE, ANHUI MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, HEFEI, CHINA.","NA",0,"1096-9071","J.

FOR CORONAVIRUSES, RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE (RDRP) IS AN IMPORTANT PROTEASE THAT CATALYZES THE REPLICATION OF RNA FROM RNA TEMPLATE AND IS AN ATTRACTIVE THERAPEUTIC TARGET. IN THIS STUDY, WE SCREENED THESE CHEMICAL STRUCTURES FROM TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINAL COMPOUNDS PROVEN TO SHOW ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY IN SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS (SARS-COV) AND THE SIMILAR CHEMICAL STRUCTURES THROUGH A MOLECULAR DOCKING STUDY TO TARGET RDRP OF SARS-COV-2, SARS-COV, AND MIDDLE EAST RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS (MERS-COV). WE FOUND THAT THEAFLAVIN HAS A LOWER IDOCK SCORE IN THE CATALYTIC POCKET OF RDRP IN SARS-COV-2 (-9.11 KCAL/MOL), SARS-COV (-8.03 KCAL/MOL), AND MERS-COV (-8.26 KCAL/MOL) FROM IDOCK. TO CONFIRM THE RESULT, WE DISCOVERED THAT THEAFLAVIN HAS LOWER BINDING ENERGY OF -8.8 KCAL/MOL WHEN IT DOCKS IN THE CATALYTIC POCKET OF SARS-COV-2 RDRP BY USING THE BLIND DOCKING SERVER. REGARDING CONTACT MODES, HYDROPHOBIC INTERACTIONS CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY IN BINDING AND ADDITIONAL HYDROGEN BONDS WERE FOUND BETWEEN THEAFLAVIN AND RDRP.

THE GENOME COMPOSITION, NUCLEOTIDE ANALYSIS, CODON USAGE INDICES, RELATIVE SYNONYMOUS CODONS USAGE, AND EFFECTIVE NUMBER OF CODONS (ENC) WERE ANALYZED IN THE FOUR STRUCTURAL GENES; SPIKE (S), ENVELOPE (E), MEMBRANE (M), AND NUCLEOCAPSID (N) GENES, AND TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT NONSTRUCTURAL GENES COMPRISING RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE AND MAIN PROTEASE (MPRO) OF SARS-COV-2, BETA-COV FROM PANGOLINS, BAT SARS, MERS, AND SARS COVS. SARS-COV-2 PREFERS PYRIMIDINE RICH CODONS TO PURINES. MOST HIGH-FREQUENCY CODONS WERE ENDING WITH A OR T, WHILE THE LOW FREQUENCY AND RARE CODONS WERE ENDING WITH G OR C. SARS-COV-2 STRUCTURAL PROTEINS SHOWED 5 TO 20 LOWER ENC VALUES, COMPARED WITH SARS, BAT SARS, AND MERS COVS. THIS IMPLIES HIGHER CODON BIAS AND HIGHER GENE EXPRESSION EFFICIENCY OF SARS-COV-2 STRUCTURAL PROTEINS. SARS-COV-2 ENCODED THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF OVER-BIASED AND NEGATIVELY BIASED CODONS. PANGOLIN BETA-COV SHOWED LITTLE DIFFERENCES WITH SARS-COV-2 ENC VALUES, COMPARED WITH SARS, BAT SARS, AND MERS COV.

INVESTIGATION OF THE SUBMITTING LABORATORIES REVEALED THAT TWO LABORATORIES FROM THE INSTITUTE OF HYDROBIOLOGY AT THE CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES IN WUHAN, CHINA PERFORMED THE RESEARCH AND SUBMITTED THE CDNA LIBRARIES TO GENBANK. THIS INSTITUTION IS VERY CLOSE IN PROXIMITY TO THE WUHAN SOUTH CHINA SEAFOOD WHOLESALE MARKET WHERE SARS-COV-2 FIRST AMPLIFIED IN THE HUMAN POPULATION.

LIMITED DATA ARE AVAILABLE FOR PREGNANT WOMEN WITH COVID-19 PNEUMONIA. THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF COVID-19 IN PREGNANCY AND THE INTRAUTERINE VERTICAL TRANSMISSION POTENTIAL OF COVID-19 INFECTION. CLINICAL RECORDS, LABORATORY RESULTS, AND CHEST CT SCANS WERE RETROSPECTIVELY REVIEWED FOR NINE PREGNANT WOMEN WITH LABORATORY-CONFIRMED COVID-19 PNEUMONIA (IE, WITH MATERNAL THROAT SWAB SAMPLES THAT WERE POSITIVE FOR SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS 2 [SARS-COV-2]) WHO WERE ADMITTED TO ZHONGNAN HOSPITAL OF WUHAN UNIVERSITY, WUHAN, CHINA, FROM JAN 20 TO JAN 31, 2020. EVIDENCE OF INTRAUTERINE VERTICAL TRANSMISSION WAS ASSESSED BY TESTING FOR THE PRESENCE OF SARS-COV-2 IN AMNIOTIC FLUID, CORD BLOOD, AND NEONATAL THROAT SWAB SAMPLES. BREASTMILK SAMPLES WERE ALSO COLLECTED AND TESTED FROM PATIENTS AFTER THE FIRST LACTATION. ALL NINE PATIENTS HAD A CAESAREAN SECTION IN THEIR THIRD TRIMESTER. SEVEN PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH A FEVER. OTHER SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING COUGH (IN FOUR OF NINE PATIENTS), MYALGIA (IN THREE), SORE THROAT (IN TWO), AND MALAISE (IN TWO), WERE ALSO OBSERVED. FETAL DISTRESS WAS MONITORED IN TWO CASES. FIVE OF NINE PATIENTS HAD LYMPHOPENIA (<1·0 × 10⁹ CELLS PER L). THREE PATIENTS HAD INCREASED AMINOTRANSFERASE CONCENTRATIONS. NONE OF THE PATIENTS DEVELOPED SEVERE COVID-19 PNEUMONIA OR DIED, AS OF FEB 4, 2020. NINE LIVEBIRTHS WERE RECORDED. NO NEONATAL ASPHYXIA WAS OBSERVED IN NEWBORN BABIES. ALL NINE LIVEBIRTHS HAD A 1-MIN APGAR SCORE OF 8-9 AND A 5-MIN APGAR SCORE OF 9-10. AMNIOTIC FLUID, CORD BLOOD, NEONATAL THROAT SWAB, AND BREASTMILK SAMPLES FROM SIX PATIENTS WERE TESTED FOR SARS-COV-2, AND ALL SAMPLES TESTED NEGATIVE FOR THE VIRUS. THE CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF COVID-19 PNEUMONIA IN PREGNANT WOMEN WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE REPORTED FOR NON-PREGNANT ADULT PATIENTS WHO DEVELOPED COVID-19 PNEUMONIA.

SARS WAS EVENTUALLY CONTAINED BY MEANS OF SYNDROMIC SURVEILLANCE, PROMPT ISOLATION OF PATIENTS, STRICT ENFORCEMENT OF QUARANTINE OF ALL CONTACTS, AND IN SOME AREAS TOP-DOWN ENFORCEMENT OF COMMUNITY QUARANTINE. BY INTERRUPTING ALL HUMAN-TO-HUMAN TRANSMISSION, SARS WAS EFFECTIVELY ERADICATED. BY CONTRAST, BY FEB 28, 2020, WITHIN A MATTER OF 2 MONTHS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE OUTBREAK OF CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19), MORE THAN 82 000 CONFIRMED CASES OF COVID-19 HAVE BEEN REPORTED WITH MORE THAN 2800 DEATHS. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE STRIKING SIMILARITIES BETWEEN SARS AND COVID-19, THE DIFFERENCES IN THE VIRUS CHARACTERISTICS WILL ULTIMATELY DETERMINE WHETHER THE SAME MEASURES FOR SARS WILL ALSO BE SUCCESSFUL FOR COVID-19. COVID-19 DIFFERS FROM SARS IN TERMS OF INFECTIOUS PERIOD, TRANSMISSIBILITY, CLINICAL SEVERITY, AND EXTENT OF COMMUNITY SPREAD. EVEN IF TRADITIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES ARE NOT ABLE TO FULLY CONTAIN THE OUTBREAK OF COVID-19, THEY WILL STILL BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING PEAK INCIDENCE AND GLOBAL DEATHS.

IN ADDITION, WE ADJUST FOR RIGHT TRUNCATION OF THE DATA AS THE EPIDEMIC IS STILL IN ITS GROWTH PHASE. ACCOUNTING FOR RIGHT TRUNCATION AND ANALYZING ALL PAIRS, WE ESTIMATED THE MEDIAN SERIAL INTERVAL AT 4.0 DAYS (95% CREDIBLE INTERVAL [CRI]: 3.1, 4.9). LIMITING OUR DATA TO ONLY THE MOST CERTAIN PAIRS, THE MEDIAN SERIAL INTERVAL WAS ESTIMATED AT 4.6 DAYS (95% CRI: 3.5, 5.9).

COVID-19 HAS SPREAD TO 46 COUNTRIES INTERNATIONALLY. TOTAL FATALITY RATE OF COVID-19 IS ESTIMATED AT 3.46% BY FAR BASED ON PUBLISHED DATA FROM THE CHINESE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CHINA CDC). AVERAGE INCUBATION PERIOD OF COVID-19 IS AROUND 6.4 DAYS, RANGES FROM 0 TO 24 DAYS. THE BASIC REPRODUCTIVE NUMBER (R  ) OF COVID-19 RANGES FROM 2 TO 3.5 AT THE EARLY PHASE REGARDLESS OF DIFFERENT PREDICTION MODELS, WHICH IS HIGHER THAN SARS AND MERS. A STUDY FROM CHINA CDC SHOWED MAJORITY OF PATIENTS (80.9%) WERE CONSIDERED ASYMPTOMATIC OR MILD PNEUMONIA BUT RELEASED LARGE AMOUNTS OF VIRUSES AT THE EARLY PHASE OF INFECTION, WHICH POSED ENORMOUS CHALLENGES FOR CONTAINING THE SPREAD OF COVID-19.

THE EPIDEMIC CURVE OF A TOTAL OF 199 CONFIRMED CASES WAS DRAWN, CLASSIFYING INDIVIDUALS INTO PASSENGERS WITH AND WITHOUT CLOSE CONTACT AND CREW MEMBERS. A BACKCALCULATION METHOD WAS EMPLOYED TO ESTIMATE THE INCIDENCE OF INFECTION. THE PEAK TIME OF INFECTION WAS SEEN FOR THE TIME PERIOD FROM 2 TO 4 FEBRUARY 2020, AND THE INCIDENCE HAS ABRUPTLY DECLINED AFTERWARDS. THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF NEW INFECTIONS AMONG PASSENGERS WITHOUT CLOSE CONTACT WAS VERY SMALL FROM 5 FEBRUARY ON WHICH A MOVEMENT RESTRICTION POLICY WAS IMPOSED. WITHOUT THE INTERVENTION FROM 5 FEBRUARY, IT WAS PREDICTED THAT THE CUMULATIVE INCIDENCE WITH AND WITHOUT CLOSE CONTACT WOULD HAVE BEEN AS LARGE AS 1373 (95% CI: 570, 2176) AND 766 (95% CI: 587, 946) CASES, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE THESE WERE KEPT TO BE 102 AND 47 CASES, RESPECTIVELY. BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF ILLNESS ONSET DATA ON BOARD, THE RISK OF INFECTION AMONG PASSENGERS WITHOUT CLOSE CONTACT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE VERY LIMITED.

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ONGOING OUTBREAK WERE COLLECTED IN REAL TIME FROM TWO MEDICAL SOCIAL MEDIA SITES. THESE WERE COMPARED AGAINST CHARACTERISTICS OF ELEVEN PATHOGENS THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY CAUSED CASES OF ATYPICAL PNEUMONIA. THE PROBABILITY THAT THE CURRENT OUTBREAK IS DUE TO ""DISEASE X"" (I.E., PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN ETIOLOGY) AS OPPOSED TO ONE OF THE KNOWN PATHOGENS WAS INFERRED, AND THIS ESTIMATE WAS UPDATED AS THE OUTBREAK CONTINUED. THE PROBABILITY (EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE) THAT DISEASE X IS DRIVING THE OUTBREAK WAS ASSESSED AS OVER 29% ON 31 DECEMBER 2019, ONE WEEK BEFORE VIRUS IDENTIFICATION. AFTER SOME SPECIFIC PATHOGENS WERE RULED OUT BY LABORATORY TESTS ON 5 JANUARY 2020, THE INFERRED PROBABILITY OF DISEASE X WAS OVER 49%.

NINE OUT OF THE 19 PATIENTS HAD 2019-NCOV INFECTION DETECTED USING OROPHARYNGEAL SWAB SAMPLES, AND THE VIRUS NUCLEIC ACID WAS ALSO DETECTED IN EIGHT OF THESE NINE PATIENTS USING STOOL SAMPLES. NONE OF POSITIVE RESULTS WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE BLOOD AND URINE SAMPLES. THESE THREE DIFFERENT KITS GOT THE SAME RESULT FOR EACH SAMPLE AND THE POSITIVE RATIO OF NUCLEIC ACID DETECTION FOR 2019-NCOV WAS ONLY 47.4% IN THE SUSPECT PATIENTS.

MODERATE TO SEVERE PROGRESSION OF THE LUNG INFILTRATES, WITH INCREASING PERCENTAGE OF HIGH-DENSITY INFILTRATES SUSTAINED BY A BILATERAL AND MULTI-SEGMENTAL EXTENSION OF LUNG OPACITIES, WERE SEEN. DURING THE FOLLOW-UP, APART FROM PLEURAL EFFUSIONS, A TUBULAR AND ENLARGED APPEARANCE OF PULMONARY VESSELS WITH A SUDDEN CALIBER REDUCTION WAS SEEN, MAINLY FOUND IN THE DICHOTOMIC TRACTS, WHERE THE CENTER OF A NEW INSURGENT PULMONARY LESION WAS SEEN. IT COULD BE AN EARLY ALERT RADIOLOGICAL SIGN TO PREDICT INITIAL LUNG DETERIORATION. ANOTHER UNCOMMON ELEMENT WAS THE PRESENCE OF MEDIASTINAL LYMPHADENOPATHY WITH SHORT-AXIS OVAL NODES. ALTHOUGH ONLY TWO PATIENTS HAVE BEEN STUDIED, THESE FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE RADIOLOGICAL PATTERN DESCRIBED IN LITERATURE.

WE ANALYZED THE DATA OF 262 CONFIRMED CASES TO DETERMINE THE CLINICAL AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF COVID-19 IN BEIJING. WE COLLECTED PATIENTS WHO WERE TRANSFERRED BY BEIJING EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE TO THE DESIGNATED HOSPITALS. THE INFORMATION ON DEMOGRAPHIC, EPIDEMIOLOGICAL, CLINICAL, LABORATORY TEST FOR THE COVID-19 VIRUS, DIAGNOSTIC CLASSIFICATION, CLUSTER CASE AND OUTCOME WERE OBTAINED. FURTHERMORE WE COMPARED THE CHARACTERISTICS BETWEEN SEVERE AND COMMON CONFIRMED CASES WHICH INCLUDING MILD CASES, NO-PNEUMONIA CASES AND ASYMPTOMATIC CASES, AND WE ALSO COMPARED THE FEATURES BETWEEN COVID-19 AND 2003 SARS. BY FEB 10, 2020, 262 PATIENTS WERE TRANSFERRED FROM THE HOSPITALS ACROSS BEIJING TO THE DESIGNATED HOSPITALS FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT OF THE COVID-19 INFECTED BY BEIJING EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE. AMONG OF 262 PATIENTS, 46 (17.6%) WERE SEVERE CASES, 216 (82.4%) WERE COMMON CASES, WHICH INCLUDING 192 (73.3%) MILD CASES, 11(4.2%) NON-PNEUMONIA CASES AND 13 (5.0%) ASYMPTOMATIC CASES RESPECTIVELY. THE MEDIAN AGE OF PATIENTS WAS 47.5 YEARS OLD AND 48.5% WERE MALE. 192 (73.3%) PATIENTS WERE RESIDENTS OF BEIJING, 50 (26.0%) OF WHICH HAD BEEN TO WUHAN, 116 (60.4%) HAD CLOSE CONTACT WITH CONFIRMED CASES, 21 (10.9%) HAD NO CONTACT HISTORY. THE MOST COMMON SYMPTOMS AT THE ONSET OF ILLNESS WERE FEVER (82.1%), COUGH (45.8%), FATIGUE (26.3%), DYSPNEA (6.9%) AND HEADACHE (6.5%). THE MEDIAN INCUBATION PERIOD WAS 6.7 DAYS, THE INTERVAL TIME FROM BETWEEN ILLNESS ONSET AND SEEING A DOCTOR WAS 4.5 DAYS. AS OF FEB 10, 17.2% PATIENTS HAVE DISCHARGED AND 81.7% PATIENTS REMAIN IN HOSPITAL IN OUR STUDY, THE FATALITY OF COVID-19 INFECTION IN BEIJING WAS 0.9%. ON THE BASIS OF THIS STUDY, WE PROVIDED THE RATIO OF THE COVID-19 INFECTION ON THE SEVERE CASES TO THE MILD, ASYMPTOMATIC AND NON-PNEUMONIA CASES IN BEIJING. POPULATION WAS GENERALLY SUSCEPTIBLE, AND WITH A RELATIVELY LOW FATALITY RATE. THE MEASURES TO PREVENT TRANSMISSION WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL AT EARLY STAGE, THE NEXT STEPS ON THE COVID-19 INFECTION SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON EARLY ISOLATION OF PATIENTS AND QUARANTINE FOR CLOSE CONTACTS IN FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES IN BEIJING.

FEVER, COUGH AND EXPECTORATION WERE THE MOST COMMON SYMPTOMS, 14 PATIENTS HAD DECREASED OXYGEN SATURATION, 33 HAD LEUKOPENIA, 53 HAD LYMPHOPENIA, AND 82 HAD ELEVATED C-REACTIVE PROTEIN. ON CHEST COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT), LUNG SEGMENTS 6 AND 10 WERE MOSTLY INVOLVED. A TOTAL OF 287 SEGMENTS PRESENTED GROUND GLASS OPACITY, 637 PRESENTED MIXED OPACITY AND 170 PRESENTED CONSOLIDATION. LESIONS WERE MORE LOCALIZED IN THE PERIPHERAL LUNG WITH A PATCHY FORM. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND BETWEEN PATIENTS WITH OR WITHOUT HUBEI EXPOSURE HISTORY. SEVENTEEN PATIENTS HAD NORMAL CT ON ADMISSION OF THESE, 12 HAD NEGATIVE FINDINGS EVEN10 DAYS LATER. MOST PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH A MILD INFECTION IN OUR STUDY. THE IMAGING PATTERN OF MULTIFOCAL PERIPHERAL GROUND GLASS OR MIXED OPACITY WITH PREDOMINANCE IN THE LOWER LUNG IS HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS OF COVID-19 IN THE FIRST WEEK OF DISEASE ONSET. NEVETHELESS, SOME PATIENTS CAN PRESENT WITH A NORMAL CHEST FINDING DESPITE TESTING POSITIVE FOR COVID-19.

LESIONS QUICKLY EVOLVED TO BILATERAL (19 [90%]), DIFFUSE (11 [52%]) GROUND-GLASS OPACITY PREDOMINANCE (17 [81%]) IN GROUP 2 (N=21). THEREAFTER, THE PREVALENCE OF GROUND-GLASS OPACITIES CONTINUED TO DECREASE (17 [57%] OF 30 PATIENTS IN GROUP 3, AND FIVE [33%] OF 15 IN GROUP 4), AND CONSOLIDATION AND MIXED PATTERNS BECAME MORE FREQUENT (12 [40%] IN GROUP 3, EIGHT [53%] IN GROUP 4). COVID-19 PNEUMONIA MANIFESTS WITH CHEST CT IMAGING ABNORMALITIES, EVEN IN ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS, WITH RAPID EVOLUTION FROM FOCAL UNILATERAL TO DIFFUSE BILATERAL GROUND-GLASS OPACITIES THAT PROGRESSED TO OR CO-EXISTED WITH CONSOLIDATIONS WITHIN 1-3 WEEKS. COMBINING ASSESSMENT OF IMAGING FEATURES WITH CLINICAL AND LABORATORY FINDINGS COULD FACILITATE EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF COVID-19 PNEUMONIA.

RESPIRATORY MEDICINE","ENGLAND","ENG","JOURNAL ARTICLE","","","","AN ONGOING OUTBREAK OF PNEUMONIA ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY CORONAVIRUS 2 (SARS-COV-2) STARTED IN DECEMBER, 2019, IN WUHAN, CHINA. INFORMATION ABOUT CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS WITH SARS-COV-2 INFECTION IS SCARCE. WE AIMED TO DESCRIBE THE CLINICAL COURSE AND OUTCOMES OF CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS WITH SARS-COV-2 PNEUMONIA. IN THIS SINGLE-CENTERED, RETROSPECTIVE, OBSERVATIONAL STUDY, WE ENROLLED 52 CRITICALLY ILL ADULT PATIENTS WITH SARS-COV-2 PNEUMONIA WHO WERE ADMITTED TO THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT (ICU) OF WUHAN JIN YIN-TAN HOSPITAL (WUHAN, CHINA) BETWEEN LATE DECEMBER, 2019, AND JAN 26, 2020. DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, SYMPTOMS, LABORATORY VALUES, COMORBIDITIES, TREATMENTS, AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES WERE ALL COLLECTED. DATA WERE COMPARED BETWEEN SURVIVORS AND NON-SURVIVORS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS 28-DAY MORTALITY, AS OF FEB 9, 2020. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED INCIDENCE OF SARS-COV-2-RELATED ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS) AND THE PROPORTION OF PATIENTS REQUIRING MECHANICAL VENTILATION. OF 710 PATIENTS WITH SARS-COV-2 PNEUMONIA, 52 CRITICALLY ILL ADULT PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. THE MEAN AGE OF THE 52 PATIENTS WAS 59·7 (SD 13·3) YEARS, 35 (67%) WERE MEN, 21 (40%) HAD CHRONIC ILLNESS, 51 (98%) HAD FEVER. 32 (61·5%) PATIENTS HAD DIED AT 28 DAYS, AND THE MEDIAN DURATION FROM ADMISSION TO THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT (ICU) TO DEATH WAS 7 (IQR 3-11) DAYS FOR NON-SURVIVORS. COMPARED WITH SURVIVORS, NON-SURVIVORS WERE OLDER (64·6 YEARS [11·2] VS 51·9 YEARS [12·9]), MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP ARDS (26 [81%] PATIENTS VS 9 [45%] PATIENTS), AND MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE MECHANICAL VENTILATION (30 [94%] PATIENTS VS 7 [35%] PATIENTS), EITHER INVASIVELY OR NON-INVASIVELY. MOST PATIENTS HAD ORGAN FUNCTION DAMAGE, INCLUDING 35 (67%) WITH ARDS, 15 (29%) WITH ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY, 12 (23%) WITH CARDIAC INJURY, 15 (29%) WITH LIVER DYSFUNCTION, AND ONE (2%) WITH PNEUMOTHORAX. 37 (71%) PATIENTS REQUIRED MECHANICAL VENTILATION. HOSPITAL-ACQUIRED INFECTION OCCURRED IN SEVEN (13·5%) PATIENTS. THE MORTALITY OF CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS WITH SARS-COV-2 PNEUMONIA IS CONSIDERABLE. THE SURVIVAL TIME OF THE NON-SURVIVORS IS LIKELY TO BE WITHIN 1-2 WEEKS AFTER ICU ADMISSION. OLDER PATIENTS (>65 YEARS) WITH COMORBIDITIES AND ARDS ARE AT INCREASED RISK OF DEATH. THE SEVERITY OF SARS-COV-2 PNEUMONIA POSES GREAT STRAIN ON CRITICAL CARE RESOURCES IN HOSPITALS, ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE NOT ADEQUATELY STAFFED OR RESOURCED.

ALTHOUGH THE VIRUS (SARS-COV-2) NUCLEIC ACID RT-PCR TEST HAS BECOME THE STANDARD METHOD FOR DIAGNOSIS OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTION, THESE REAL-TIME PCR TEST KITS HAVE MANY LIMITATIONS. IN ADDITION, HIGH FALSE NEGATIVE RATES WERE REPORTED. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR AN ACCURATE AND RAPID TEST METHOD TO QUICKLY IDENTIFY LARGE NUMBER OF INFECTED PATIENTS AND ASYMPTOMATIC CARRIERS TO PREVENT VIRUS TRANSMISSION AND ASSURE TIMELY TREATMENT OF PATIENTS. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A RAPID AND SIMPLE POINT-OF-CARE LATERAL FLOW IMMUNOASSAY WHICH CAN DETECT IGM AND IGG ANTIBODIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AGAINST SARS-COV-2 VIRUS IN HUMAN BLOOD WITHIN 15 MINUTES WHICH CAN DETECT PATIENTS AT DIFFERENT INFECTION STAGES. WITH THIS TEST KIT, WE CARRIED OUT CLINICAL STUDIES TO VALIDATE ITS CLINICAL EFFICACY USES. THE CLINICAL DETECTION SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF THIS TEST WERE MEASURED USING BLOOD SAMPLES COLLECTED FROM 397 PCR CONFIRMED COVID-19 PATIENTS AND 128 NEGATIVE PATIENTS AT 8 DIFFERENT CLINICAL SITES. THE OVERALL TESTING SENSITIVITY WAS 88.66% AND SPECIFICITY WAS 90.63%. IN ADDITION, WE EVALUATED CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS RESULTS OBTAINED FROM DIFFERENT TYPES OF VENOUS AND FINGERSTICK BLOOD SAMPLES. THE RESULTS INDICATED GREAT DETECTION CONSISTENCY AMONG SAMPLES FROM FINGERSTICK BLOOD, SERUM AND PLASMA OF VENOUS BLOOD. THE IGM-IGG COMBINED ASSAY HAS BETTER UTILITY AND SENSITIVITY COMPARED WITH A SINGLE IGM OR IGG TEST. IT CAN BE USED FOR THE RAPID SCREENING OF SARS-COV-2 CARRIERS, SYMPTOMATIC OR ASYMPTOMATIC, IN HOSPITALS, CLINICS, AND TEST LABORATORIES. THIS ARTICLE IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT.

THIS VIRUS SHARES HIGHLY HOMOLOGICAL SEQUENCE WITH SARS-COV, AND CAUSES ACUTE, HIGHLY LETHAL PNEUMONIA CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) WITH CLINICAL SYMPTOMS SIMILAR TO THOSE REPORTED FOR SARS-COV AND MERS-COV. THE MOST CHARACTERISTIC SYMPTOM OF PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 IS RESPIRATORY DISTRESS, AND MOST OF THE PATIENTS ADMITTED TO THE INTENSIVE CARE COULD NOT BREATHE SPONTANEOUSLY. ADDITIONALLY, SOME PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 ALSO SHOWED NEUROLOGIC SIGNS, SUCH AS HEADACHE, NAUSEA, AND VOMITING. INCREASING EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT CORONAVIRUSES ARE NOT ALWAYS CONFINED TO THE RESPIRATORY TRACT AND THAT THEY MAY ALSO INVADE THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM INDUCING NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES. THE INFECTION OF SARS-COV HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THE BRAINS FROM BOTH PATIENTS AND EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS, WHERE THE BRAINSTEM WAS HEAVILY INFECTED. FURTHERMORE, SOME CORONAVIRUSES HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED ABLE TO SPREAD VIA A SYNAPSE-CONNECTED ROUTE TO THE MEDULLARY CARDIORESPIRATORY CENTER FROM THE MECHANORECEPTORS AND CHEMORECEPTORS IN THE LUNG AND LOWER RESPIRATORY AIRWAYS. CONSIDERING THE HIGH SIMILARITY BETWEEN SARS-COV AND SARS-COV2, IT REMAINS TO MAKE CLEAR WHETHER THE POTENTIAL INVASION OF SARS-COV2 IS PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE OF PATIENTS WITH COVID-19.

TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL INTERMEDIATE ANIMAL HOST OF THE SARS-COV-2 VIRUS, WE REANALYZED VIROME DATA SETS FROM PANGOLINS AND REPRESENTATIVE SARS-RELATED CORONAVIRUSES ISOLATES FROM BATS, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION PAID TO THE SPIKE GLYCOPROTEIN GENE. WE PERFORMED PHYLOGENETIC, SPLIT NETWORK, TRANSMISSION NETWORK, LIKELIHOOD-MAPPING, AND COMPARATIVE ANALYSES OF THE GENOMES. BASED ON BAYESIAN TIME-SCALED PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS USING THE TIP-DATING METHOD, WE ESTIMATED THE TIME TO THE MOST RECENT COMMON ANCESTOR AND EVOLUTIONARY RATE OF SARS-COV-2, WHICH RANGED FROM 22 TO 24 NOVEMBER 2019 AND 1.19 TO 1.31 × 10  SUBSTITUTIONS PER SITE PER YEAR, RESPECTIVELY. OUR RESULTS ALSO REVEALED THAT THE BETACOV/BAT/YUNNAN/RATG13/2013 VIRUS WAS MORE SIMILAR TO THE SARS-COV-2 VIRUS THAN THE CORONAVIRUS OBTAINED FROM THE TWO PANGOLIN SAMPLES (SRR10168377 AND SRR10168378). WE ALSO IDENTIFIED A UNIQUE PEPTIDE (PRRA) INSERTION IN THE HUMAN SARS-COV-2 VIRUS, WHICH MAY BE INVOLVED IN THE PROTEOLYTIC CLEAVAGE OF THE SPIKE PROTEIN BY CELLULAR PROTEASES, AND THUS COULD IMPACT HOST RANGE AND TRANSMISSIBILITY. INTERESTINGLY, THE CORONAVIRUS CARRIED BY PANGOLINS DID NOT HAVE THE RRAR MOTIF. THEREFORE, WE CONCLUDED THAT THE HUMAN SARS-COV-2 VIRUS, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RECENT OUTBREAK OF COVID-19, DID NOT COME DIRECTLY FROM PANGOLINS.","HUBEI ENGINEERING RESEARCH CENTER OF VIRAL VECTOR, WUHAN UNIVERSITY OF BIOENGINEERING, WUHAN, CHINA.;IMMUNOLOGY INNOVATION TEAM, SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, NINGBO UNIVERSITY, NINGBO, CHINA.;PRECISION CANCER CENTER AIRPORT CENTER, TIANJIN CANCER HOSPITAL AIRPORT HOSPITAL, TIANJIN, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY, WEIFANG CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, WEIFANG, CHINA.;HUBEI ENGINEERING RESEARCH CENTER OF VIRAL VECTOR, WUHAN UNIVERSITY OF BIOENGINEERING, WUHAN, CHINA.;HIV DATABASES, THEORETICAL BIOLOGY AND BIOPHYSICS GROUP, LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY, LOS ALAMOS, NEW MEXICO.;DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO, LA JOLLA, CALIFORNIA.","NA",0,"1096-9071","J.

HOWEVER, THERE ARE THREE TECHNICAL OBSTACLES THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO APPROPRIATELY MEASURE THIS RISK. FIRST, DIVISION OF THE CUMULATIVE NUMBER OF DEATHS BY THAT OF CASES TENDS TO UNDERESTIMATE THE ACTUAL RISK BECAUSE DEATHS THAT WILL OCCUR HAVE NOT YET OBSERVED, AND SO THE DELAY IN TIME FROM ILLNESS ONSET TO DEATH MUST BE ADDRESSED. SECOND, THE OBSERVED DATASET OF REPORTED CASES REPRESENTS ONLY A PROPORTION OF ALL INFECTED INDIVIDUALS AND THERE CAN BE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF ASYMPTOMATIC AND MILDLY INFECTED INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NEVER DIAGNOSED. THIRD, ASCERTAINMENT BIAS AND RISK OF DEATH AMONG ALL THOSE INFECTED WOULD BE SMALLER WHEN ESTIMATED USING SHORTER VIRUS DETECTION WINDOWS AND LESS SENSITIVE DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORY TESTS.

HUMAN-TO-HUMAN TRANSMISSION IS CONFIRMED, AND THIS DISEASE (NAMED COVID-19 BY WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO)) SPREAD RAPIDLY AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD. AS OF 18 FEBRUARY 2020, THE NUMBER OF CONFIRMED CASES HAD REACHED 75,199 WITH 2009 FATALITIES. THE COVID-19 RESULTED IN A MUCH LOWER CASE-FATALITY RATE (ABOUT 2.67%) AMONG THE CONFIRMED CASES, COMPARED WITH SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (SARS) AND MIDDLE EAST RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (MERS). AMONG THE SYMPTOM COMPOSITION OF THE 45 FATALITY CASES COLLECTED FROM THE RELEASED OFFICIAL REPORTS, THE TOP FOUR ARE FEVER, COUGH, SHORT OF BREATH, AND CHEST TIGHTNESS/PAIN. THE MAJOR COMORBIDITIES OF THE FATALITY CASES INCLUDE HYPERTENSION, DIABETES, CORONARY HEART DISEASE, CEREBRAL INFARCTION, AND CHRONIC BRONCHITIS. THE SOURCE OF THE VIRUS AND THE PATHOGENESIS OF THIS DISEASE ARE STILL UNCONFIRMED. NO SPECIFIC THERAPEUTIC DRUG HAS BEEN FOUND. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS INITIATED A LEVEL-1 PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE.

WE FOUND THAT IN COUNTRIES WITH LOW CONNECTIVITY TO CHINA BUT WITH RELATIVELY HIGH R LOC , THE MOST BENEFICIAL CONTROL MEASURE TO REDUCE THE RISK OF OUTBREAKS IS A FURTHER REDUCTION IN THEIR IMPORTATION NUMBER EITHER BY ENTRY SCREENING OR TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS. COUNTRIES WITH HIGH CONNECTIVITY BUT LOW R LOC BENEFIT THE MOST FROM POLICIES THAT FURTHER REDUCE R LOC . COUNTRIES IN THE MIDDLE SHOULD CONSIDER A COMBINATION OF SUCH POLICIES.

LOCAL CYCLES OF TRANSMISSION HAVE ALREADY OCCURRED IN 12 COUNTRIES AFTER CASE IMPORTATION. IN AFRICA, EGYPT HAS SO FAR CONFIRMED ONE CASE. THE MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF COVID-19 IMPORTATIONS HEAVILY RELY ON A COUNTRY'S HEALTH CAPACITY. HERE WE EVALUATE THE PREPAREDNESS AND VULNERABILITY OF AFRICAN COUNTRIES AGAINST THEIR RISK OF IMPORTATION OF COVID-19. WE USED DATA ON THE VOLUME OF AIR TRAVEL DEPARTING FROM AIRPORTS IN THE INFECTED PROVINCES IN CHINA AND DIRECTED TO AFRICA TO ESTIMATE THE RISK OF IMPORTATION PER COUNTRY. WE DETERMINED THE COUNTRY'S CAPACITY TO DETECT AND RESPOND TO CASES WITH TWO INDICATORS: PREPAREDNESS, USING THE WHO INTERNATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS MONITORING AND EVALUATION FRAMEWORK; AND VULNERABILITY, USING THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE VULNERABILITY INDEX. COUNTRIES WERE CLUSTERED ACCORDING TO THE CHINESE REGIONS CONTRIBUTING MOST TO THEIR RISK. COUNTRIES WITH THE HIGHEST IMPORTATION RISK (IE, EGYPT, ALGERIA, AND SOUTH AFRICA) HAVE MODERATE TO HIGH CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO OUTBREAKS. COUNTRIES AT MODERATE RISK (IE, NIGERIA, ETHIOPIA, SUDAN, ANGOLA, TANZANIA, GHANA, AND KENYA) HAVE VARIABLE CAPACITY AND HIGH VULNERABILITY. WE IDENTIFIED THREE CLUSTERS OF COUNTRIES THAT SHARE THE SAME EXPOSURE TO THE RISK ORIGINATING FROM THE PROVINCES OF GUANGDONG, FUJIAN, AND THE CITY OF BEIJING, RESPECTIVELY. MANY COUNTRIES IN AFRICA ARE STEPPING UP THEIR PREPAREDNESS TO DETECT AND COPE WITH COVID-19 IMPORTATIONS. RESOURCES, INTENSIFIED SURVEILLANCE, AND CAPACITY BUILDING SHOULD BE URGENTLY PRIORITISED IN COUNTRIES WITH MODERATE RISK THAT MIGHT BE ILL-PREPARED TO DETECT IMPORTED CASES AND TO LIMIT ONWARD TRANSMISSION.

THE VIRUS KNOWLEDGE IS LIMITED AND ESPECIALLY ABOUT COVID-2019 PATHOGENESIS. THE OPEN READING FRAME 1AB (ORF1AB) OF COVID-2019 HAS BEEN ANALYZED TO EVIDENCE THE PRESENCE OF MUTATION CAUSED BY SELECTIVE PRESSURE ON THE VIRUS. FOR SELECTIVE PRESSURE ANALYSIS FAST-UNCONSTRAINED BAYESIAN APPROXIMATION (FUBAR) WAS USED. HOMOLOGY MODELLING HAS BEEN PERFORMED BY SWISSMODEL AND HHPRED SERVERS. THE PRESENCE OF TRANSMEMBRANE HELICAL SEGMENTS IN CORONAVIRUS ORF1AB NON STRUCTURAL PROTEIN 2 (NSP2) AND NSP3 WAS TESTED BY TMHMM, MEMSAT, AND MEMPACK TOOLS. THREE-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURES HAVE BEEN ANALYZED AND DISPLAYED USING PYMOL. FUBAR ANALYSIS REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF POTENTIAL SITES UNDER POSITIVE SELECTIVE PRESSURE (P < .05). POSITION 723 IN THE COVID-2019 HAS A SERINE INSTEAD A GLYCINE RESIDUE, WHILE AT AMINOACIDIC POSITION 1010 A PROLINE INSTEAD AN ISOLEUCINE. SIGNIFICANT (P < .05) PERVASIVE NEGATIVE SELECTION IN 2416 SITES (55%) WAS FOUND. THE POSITIVE SELECTIVE PRESSURE COULD ACCOUNT FOR SOME CLINICAL FEATURES OF THIS VIRUS COMPARED WITH SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (SARS) AND BAT SARS-LIKE COV. THE STABILIZING MUTATION FALLING IN THE ENDOSOME-ASSOCIATED-PROTEIN-LIKE DOMAIN OF THE NSP2 PROTEIN COULD ACCOUNT FOR COVID-2019 HIGH ABILITY OF CONTAGIOUS, WHILE THE DESTABILIZING MUTATION IN NSP3 PROTEINS COULD SUGGEST A POTENTIAL MECHANISM DIFFERENTIATING COVID-2019 FROM SARS. THESE DATA COULD BE HELPFUL FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AIMED TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC TARGETS OR VACCINE STRATEGY, ESPECIALLY IN THE ACTUAL MOMENT WHEN THE EPIDEMIC IS ONGOING AND THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY IS TRYING TO ENRICH KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THIS NEW VIRAL PATHOGEN.","UNIT OF CLINICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY CAMPUS BIO-MEDICO OF ROME, ROME, ITALY.;UNIT OF MEDICAL STATISTICS AND MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY CAMPUS BIO-MEDICO OF ROME, ROME, ITALY.;DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHEMICAL SCIENCES ""A.

AS OF 11 FEBRUARY 2020, DATA FROM THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) HAVE SHOWN THAT MORE THAN 43 000 CONFIRMED CASES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN 28 COUNTRIES/REGIONS, WITH >99% OF CASES BEING DETECTED IN CHINA. ON 30 JANUARY 2020, THE WHO DECLARED COVID-19 AS THE SIXTH PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY OF INTERNATIONAL CONCERN. SARS-COV-2 IS CLOSELY RELATED TO TWO BAT-DERIVED SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME-LIKE CORONAVIRUSES, BAT-SL-COVZC45 AND BAT-SL-COVZXC21. IT IS SPREAD BY HUMAN-TO-HUMAN TRANSMISSION VIA DROPLETS OR DIRECT CONTACT, AND INFECTION HAS BEEN ESTIMATED TO HAVE MEAN INCUBATION PERIOD OF 6.4 DAYS AND A BASIC REPRODUCTION NUMBER OF 2.24-3.58. AMONG PATIENTS WITH PNEUMONIA CAUSED BY SARS-COV-2 (NOVEL CORONAVIRUS PNEUMONIA OR WUHAN PNEUMONIA), FEVER WAS THE MOST COMMON SYMPTOM, FOLLOWED BY COUGH. BILATERAL LUNG INVOLVEMENT WITH GROUND-GLASS OPACITY WAS THE MOST COMMON FINDING FROM COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY IMAGES OF THE CHEST. THE ONE CASE OF SARS-COV-2 PNEUMONIA IN THE USA IS RESPONDING WELL TO REMDESIVIR, WHICH IS NOW UNDERGOING A CLINICAL TRIAL IN CHINA. CURRENTLY, CONTROLLING INFECTION TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF SARS-COV-2 IS THE PRIMARY INTERVENTION BEING USED.

USING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE EVENT-DATE DATA FROM THE ONGOING EPIDEMIC, THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATED THE INCUBATION PERIOD AND OTHER TIME INTERVALS THAT GOVERN THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DYNAMICS OF COVID-19 INFECTIONS. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE INCUBATION PERIOD FALLS WITHIN THE RANGE OF 2-14 DAYS WITH 95% CONFIDENCE AND HAS A MEAN OF AROUND 5 DAYS WHEN APPROXIMATED USING THE BEST-FIT LOGNORMAL DISTRIBUTION. THE MEAN TIME FROM ILLNESS ONSET TO HOSPITAL ADMISSION (FOR TREATMENT AND/OR ISOLATION) WAS ESTIMATED AT 3-4 DAYS WITHOUT TRUNCATION AND AT 5-9 DAYS WHEN RIGHT TRUNCATED.

KNOWLEDGE OF THE CCFR IS CRITICAL TO CHARACTERIZE THE SEVERITY AND UNDERSTAND THE PANDEMIC POTENTIAL OF COVID-19 IN THE EARLY STAGE OF THE EPIDEMIC. USING THE EXPONENTIAL GROWTH RATE OF THE INCIDENCE, THE PRESENT STUDY STATISTICALLY ESTIMATED THE CCFR AND THE BASIC REPRODUCTION NUMBER-THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF SECONDARY CASES GENERATED BY A SINGLE PRIMARY CASE IN A NAÏVE POPULATION. WE MODELED EPIDEMIC GROWTH EITHER FROM A SINGLE INDEX CASE WITH ILLNESS ONSET ON 8 DECEMBER, 2019 (SCENARIO 1), OR USING THE GROWTH RATE FITTED ALONG WITH THE OTHER PARAMETERS (SCENARIO 2) BASED ON DATA FROM 20 EXPORTED CASES REPORTED BY 24 JANUARY 2020. THE CUMULATIVE INCIDENCE IN CHINA BY 24 JANUARY WAS ESTIMATED AT 6924 CASES (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI]: 4885, 9211) AND 19,289 CASES (95% CI: 10,901, 30,158), RESPECTIVELY. THE LATEST ESTIMATED VALUES OF THE CCFR WERE 5.3% (95% CI: 3.5%, 7.5%) FOR SCENARIO 1 AND 8.4% (95% CI: 5.3%, 12.3%) FOR SCENARIO 2. THE BASIC REPRODUCTION NUMBER WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 2.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.2) AND 3.2 (95% CI: 2.7, 3.7) FOR SCENARIOS 1 AND 2, RESPECTIVELY. BASED ON THESE RESULTS, WE ARGUED THAT THE CURRENT COVID-19 EPIDEMIC HAS A SUBSTANTIAL POTENTIAL FOR CAUSING A PANDEMIC.

HUMAN-TO-HUMAN TRANSMISSIONS HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED WITH INCUBATION TIMES BETWEEN 2-10 DAYS, FACILITATING ITS SPREAD VIA DROPLETS, CONTAMINATED HANDS OR SURFACES. WE THEREFORE REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PERSISTENCE OF HUMAN AND VETERINARY CORONAVIRUSES ON INANIMATE SURFACES AS WELL AS INACTIVATION STRATEGIES WITH BIOCIDAL AGENTS USED FOR CHEMICAL DISINFECTION, E.G. IN HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. THE ANALYSIS OF 22 STUDIES REVEALS THAT HUMAN CORONAVIRUSES SUCH AS SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (SARS) CORONAVIRUS, MIDDLE EAST RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (MERS) CORONAVIRUS OR ENDEMIC HUMAN CORONAVIRUSES (HCOV) CAN PERSIST ON INANIMATE SURFACES LIKE METAL, GLASS OR PLASTIC FOR UP TO 9 DAYS, BUT CAN BE EFFICIENTLY INACTIVATED BY SURFACE DISINFECTION PROCEDURES WITH 62-71% ETHANOL, 0.5% HYDROGEN PEROXIDE OR 0.1% SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE WITHIN 1 MINUTE. OTHER BIOCIDAL AGENTS SUCH AS 0.05-0.2% BENZALKONIUM CHLORIDE OR 0.02% CHLORHEXIDINE DIGLUCONATE ARE LESS EFFECTIVE. AS NO SPECIFIC THERAPIES ARE AVAILABLE FOR SARS-COV-2, EARLY CONTAINMENT AND PREVENTION OF FURTHER SPREAD WILL BE CRUCIAL TO STOP THE ONGOING OUTBREAK AND TO CONTROL THIS NOVEL INFECTIOUS THREAD.","UNIVERSITY MEDICINE GREIFSWALD, INSTITUTE FOR HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE, FERDINAND-SAUERBRUCH-STRAßE, 17475 GREIFSWALD;DEPARTMENT OF MOLECULAR AND MEDICAL VIROLOGY, RUHR UNIVERSITY BOCHUM, UNIVERSITÄTSSTRASSE 50, 44801 BOCHUM, GERMANY.;DEPARTMENT OF MOLECULAR AND MEDICAL VIROLOGY, RUHR UNIVERSITY BOCHUM, UNIVERSITÄTSSTRASSE 50, 44801 BOCHUM, GERMANY.;DEPARTMENT OF MOLECULAR AND MEDICAL VIROLOGY, RUHR UNIVERSITY BOCHUM, UNIVERSITÄTSSTRASSE 50, 44801 BOCHUM, GERMANY.","NA",0,"1532-2939","J.

IN THIS SHORT REPORT, PHYLOGENETIC RECONSTRUCTION WAS USED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS OF THE VIRUS FROM ITS FIRST INTRODUCTION IN CHINA FOCUSING ON THE MORE RECENT EVIDENCE OF INFECTION IN A COUPLE OF CHINESE TOURISTS ARRIVED IN ITALY ON 23RD JANUARY 2020 AND LABELED AS CORONAVIRUS ITALIAN CASES. A MAXIMUM CLADE CREDIBILITY TREE HAS BEEN BUILT USING A DATASET OF 54 GENOME SEQUENCES OF 2019-NCOV PLUS TWO CLOSELY RELATED BAT STRAINS (SARS-LIKE COV) AVAILABLE IN GENBANK. BAYESIAN TIME-SCALED PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS WAS IMPLEMENTED IN BEAST 1.10.4. THE BAYESIAN PHYLOGENETIC RECONSTRUCTION SHOWED THAT 2019-2020 NCOV FIRSTLY INTRODUCED IN WUHAN ON 25 NOVEMBER 2019, STARTED EPIDEMIC TRANSMISSION REACHING MANY COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING EUROPE AND ITALY WHERE THE TWO STRAINS ISOLATED DATED BACK 19 JANUARY 2020, THE SAME THAT THE CHINESE TOURISTS ARRIVED IN ITALY. STRAINS ISOLATED OUTSIDE CHINA WERE INTERMIXED WITH STRAINS ISOLATED IN CHINA AS EVIDENCE OF LIKELY IMPORTED CASES IN ROME, ITALY, AND EUROPE, AS WELL.

CASES HAVE BEEN EXPORTED TO OTHER CHINESE CITIES, AS WELL AS INTERNATIONALLY, THREATENING TO TRIGGER A GLOBAL OUTBREAK. HERE, WE PROVIDE AN ESTIMATE OF THE SIZE OF THE EPIDEMIC IN WUHAN ON THE BASIS OF THE NUMBER OF CASES EXPORTED FROM WUHAN TO CITIES OUTSIDE MAINLAND CHINA AND FORECAST THE EXTENT OF THE DOMESTIC AND GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS OF EPIDEMICS, ACCOUNTING FOR SOCIAL AND NON-PHARMACEUTICAL PREVENTION INTERVENTIONS. WE USED DATA FROM DEC 31, 2019, TO JAN 28, 2020, ON THE NUMBER OF CASES EXPORTED FROM WUHAN INTERNATIONALLY (KNOWN DAYS OF SYMPTOM ONSET FROM DEC 25, 2019, TO JAN 19, 2020) TO INFER THE NUMBER OF INFECTIONS IN WUHAN FROM DEC 1, 2019, TO JAN 25, 2020. CASES EXPORTED DOMESTICALLY WERE THEN ESTIMATED. WE FORECASTED THE NATIONAL AND GLOBAL SPREAD OF 2019-NCOV, ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECT OF THE METROPOLITAN-WIDE QUARANTINE OF WUHAN AND SURROUNDING CITIES, WHICH BEGAN JAN 23-24, 2020. WE USED DATA ON MONTHLY FLIGHT BOOKINGS FROM THE OFFICIAL AVIATION GUIDE AND DATA ON HUMAN MOBILITY ACROSS MORE THAN 300 PREFECTURE-LEVEL CITIES IN MAINLAND CHINA FROM THE TENCENT DATABASE. DATA ON CONFIRMED CASES WERE OBTAINED FROM THE REPORTS PUBLISHED BY THE CHINESE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. SERIAL INTERVAL ESTIMATES WERE BASED ON PREVIOUS STUDIES OF SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS (SARS-COV). A SUSCEPTIBLE-EXPOSED-INFECTIOUS-RECOVERED METAPOPULATION MODEL WAS USED TO SIMULATE THE EPIDEMICS ACROSS ALL MAJOR CITIES IN CHINA. THE BASIC REPRODUCTIVE NUMBER WAS ESTIMATED USING MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO METHODS AND PRESENTED USING THE RESULTING POSTERIOR MEAN AND 95% CREDIBILE INTERVAL (CRI). IN OUR BASELINE SCENARIO, WE ESTIMATED THAT THE BASIC REPRODUCTIVE NUMBER FOR 2019-NCOV WAS 2·68 (95% CRI 2·47-2·86) AND THAT 75 815 INDIVIDUALS (95% CRI 37 304-130 330) HAVE BEEN INFECTED IN WUHAN AS OF JAN 25, 2020. THE EPIDEMIC DOUBLING TIME WAS 6·4 DAYS (95% CRI 5·8-7·1). WE ESTIMATED THAT IN THE BASELINE SCENARIO, CHONGQING, BEIJING, SHANGHAI, GUANGZHOU, AND SHENZHEN HAD IMPORTED 461 (95% CRI 227-805), 113 (57-193), 98 (49-168), 111 (56-191), AND 80 (40-139) INFECTIONS FROM WUHAN, RESPECTIVELY. IF THE TRANSMISSIBILITY OF 2019-NCOV WERE SIMILAR EVERYWHERE DOMESTICALLY AND OVER TIME, WE INFERRED THAT EPIDEMICS ARE ALREADY GROWING EXPONENTIALLY IN MULTIPLE MAJOR CITIES OF CHINA WITH A LAG TIME BEHIND THE WUHAN OUTBREAK OF ABOUT 1-2 WEEKS. GIVEN THAT 2019-NCOV IS NO LONGER CONTAINED WITHIN WUHAN, OTHER MAJOR CHINESE CITIES ARE PROBABLY SUSTAINING LOCALISED OUTBREAKS. LARGE CITIES OVERSEAS WITH CLOSE TRANSPORT LINKS TO CHINA COULD ALSO BECOME OUTBREAK EPICENTRES, UNLESS SUBSTANTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS AT BOTH THE POPULATION AND PERSONAL LEVELS ARE IMPLEMENTED IMMEDIATELY. INDEPENDENT SELF-SUSTAINING OUTBREAKS IN MAJOR CITIES GLOBALLY COULD BECOME INEVITABLE BECAUSE OF SUBSTANTIAL EXPORTATION OF PRESYMPTOMATIC CASES AND IN THE ABSENCE OF LARGE-SCALE PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS.

A NOVEL CORONAVIRUS WAS SUBSEQUENTLY IDENTIFIED AS THE CAUSATIVE PATHOGEN, PROVISIONALLY NAMED 2019 NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (2019-NCOV). AS OF JAN 26, 2020, MORE THAN 2000 CASES OF 2019-NCOV INFECTION HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED, MOST OF WHICH INVOLVED PEOPLE LIVING IN OR VISITING WUHAN, AND HUMAN-TO-HUMAN TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN CONFIRMED. WE DID NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING OF SAMPLES FROM BRONCHOALVEOLAR LAVAGE FLUID AND CULTURED ISOLATES FROM NINE INPATIENTS, EIGHT OF WHOM HAD VISITED THE HUANAN SEAFOOD MARKET IN WUHAN. COMPLETE AND PARTIAL 2019-NCOV GENOME SEQUENCES WERE OBTAINED FROM THESE INDIVIDUALS. VIRAL CONTIGS WERE CONNECTED USING SANGER SEQUENCING TO OBTAIN THE FULL-LENGTH GENOMES, WITH THE TERMINAL REGIONS DETERMINED BY RAPID AMPLIFICATION OF CDNA ENDS. PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF THESE 2019-NCOV GENOMES AND THOSE OF OTHER CORONAVIRUSES WAS USED TO DETERMINE THE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF THE VIRUS AND HELP INFER ITS LIKELY ORIGIN. HOMOLOGY MODELLING WAS DONE TO EXPLORE THE LIKELY RECEPTOR-BINDING PROPERTIES OF THE VIRUS. THE TEN GENOME SEQUENCES OF 2019-NCOV OBTAINED FROM THE NINE PATIENTS WERE EXTREMELY SIMILAR, EXHIBITING MORE THAN 99·98% SEQUENCE IDENTITY. NOTABLY, 2019-NCOV WAS CLOSELY RELATED (WITH 88% IDENTITY) TO TWO BAT-DERIVED SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (SARS)-LIKE CORONAVIRUSES, BAT-SL-COVZC45 AND BAT-SL-COVZXC21, COLLECTED IN 2018 IN ZHOUSHAN, EASTERN CHINA, BUT WERE MORE DISTANT FROM SARS-COV (ABOUT 79%) AND MERS-COV (ABOUT 50%). PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT 2019-NCOV FELL WITHIN THE SUBGENUS SARBECOVIRUS OF THE GENUS BETACORONAVIRUS, WITH A RELATIVELY LONG BRANCH LENGTH TO ITS CLOSEST RELATIVES BAT-SL-COVZC45 AND BAT-SL-COVZXC21, AND WAS GENETICALLY DISTINCT FROM SARS-COV. NOTABLY, HOMOLOGY MODELLING REVEALED THAT 2019-NCOV HAD A SIMILAR RECEPTOR-BINDING DOMAIN STRUCTURE TO THAT OF SARS-COV, DESPITE AMINO ACID VARIATION AT SOME KEY RESIDUES. 2019-NCOV IS SUFFICIENTLY DIVERGENT FROM SARS-COV TO BE CONSIDERED A NEW HUMAN-INFECTING BETACORONAVIRUS. ALTHOUGH OUR PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT BATS MIGHT BE THE ORIGINAL HOST OF THIS VIRUS, AN ANIMAL SOLD AT THE SEAFOOD MARKET IN WUHAN MIGHT REPRESENT AN INTERMEDIATE HOST FACILITATING THE EMERGENCE OF THE VIRUS IN HUMANS. IMPORTANTLY, STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT 2019-NCOV MIGHT BE ABLE TO BIND TO THE ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING ENZYME 2 RECEPTOR IN HUMANS.

WE AIMED TO FURTHER CLARIFY THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF 2019-NCOV PNEUMONIA. IN THIS RETROSPECTIVE, SINGLE-CENTRE STUDY, WE INCLUDED ALL CONFIRMED CASES OF 2019-NCOV IN WUHAN JINYINTAN HOSPITAL FROM JAN 1 TO JAN 20, 2020. CASES WERE CONFIRMED BY REAL-TIME RT-PCR AND WERE ANALYSED FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL, DEMOGRAPHIC, CLINICAL, AND RADIOLOGICAL FEATURES AND LABORATORY DATA. OUTCOMES WERE FOLLOWED UP UNTIL JAN 25, 2020. OF THE 99 PATIENTS WITH 2019-NCOV PNEUMONIA, 49 (49%) HAD A HISTORY OF EXPOSURE TO THE HUANAN SEAFOOD MARKET. THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE PATIENTS WAS 55·5 YEARS (SD 13·1), INCLUDING 67 MEN AND 32 WOMEN. 2019-NCOV WAS DETECTED IN ALL PATIENTS BY REAL-TIME RT-PCR. 50 (51%) PATIENTS HAD CHRONIC DISEASES. PATIENTS HAD CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF FEVER (82 [83%] PATIENTS), COUGH (81 [82%] PATIENTS), SHORTNESS OF BREATH (31 [31%] PATIENTS), MUSCLE ACHE (11 [11%] PATIENTS), CONFUSION (NINE [9%] PATIENTS), HEADACHE (EIGHT [8%] PATIENTS), SORE THROAT (FIVE [5%] PATIENTS), RHINORRHOEA (FOUR [4%] PATIENTS), CHEST PAIN (TWO [2%] PATIENTS), DIARRHOEA (TWO [2%] PATIENTS), AND NAUSEA AND VOMITING (ONE [1%] PATIENT). ACCORDING TO IMAGING EXAMINATION, 74 (75%) PATIENTS SHOWED BILATERAL PNEUMONIA, 14 (14%) PATIENTS SHOWED MULTIPLE MOTTLING AND GROUND-GLASS OPACITY, AND ONE (1%) PATIENT HAD PNEUMOTHORAX. 17 (17%) PATIENTS DEVELOPED ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME AND, AMONG THEM, 11 (11%) PATIENTS WORSENED IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND DIED OF MULTIPLE ORGAN FAILURE. THE 2019-NCOV INFECTION WAS OF CLUSTERING ONSET, IS MORE LIKELY TO AFFECT OLDER MALES WITH COMORBIDITIES, AND CAN RESULT IN SEVERE AND EVEN FATAL RESPIRATORY DISEASES SUCH AS ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME. IN GENERAL, CHARACTERISTICS OF PATIENTS WHO DIED WERE IN LINE WITH THE MULBSTA SCORE, AN EARLY WARNING MODEL FOR PREDICTING MORTALITY IN VIRAL PNEUMONIA. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS NEEDED TO EXPLORE THE APPLICABILITY OF THE MULBSTA SCORE IN PREDICTING THE RISK OF MORTALITY IN 2019-NCOV INFECTION.

WE PROSPECTIVELY COLLECTED AND ANALYSED DATA ON PATIENTS WITH LABORATORY-CONFIRMED 2019-NCOV INFECTION BY REAL-TIME RT-PCR AND NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING. DATA WERE OBTAINED WITH STANDARDISED DATA COLLECTION FORMS SHARED BY WHO AND THE INTERNATIONAL SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY AND EMERGING INFECTION CONSORTIUM FROM ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS. RESEARCHERS ALSO DIRECTLY COMMUNICATED WITH PATIENTS OR THEIR FAMILIES TO ASCERTAIN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND SYMPTOM DATA.

MOST OF THE INFECTED PATIENTS WERE MEN (30 [73%] OF 41); LESS THAN HALF HAD UNDERLYING DISEASES (13 [32%]), INCLUDING DIABETES (EIGHT [20%]), HYPERTENSION (SIX [15%]), AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (SIX [15%]). MEDIAN AGE WAS 49·0 YEARS (IQR 41·0-58·0). 27 (66%) OF 41 PATIENTS HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO HUANAN SEAFOOD MARKET. ONE FAMILY CLUSTER WAS FOUND. COMMON SYMPTOMS AT ONSET OF ILLNESS WERE FEVER (40 [98%] OF 41 PATIENTS), COUGH (31 [76%]), AND MYALGIA OR FATIGUE (18 [44%]); LESS COMMON SYMPTOMS WERE SPUTUM PRODUCTION (11 [28%] OF 39), HEADACHE (THREE [8%] OF 38), HAEMOPTYSIS (TWO [5%] OF 39), AND DIARRHOEA (ONE [3%] OF 38). DYSPNOEA DEVELOPED IN 22 (55%) OF 40 PATIENTS (MEDIAN TIME FROM ILLNESS ONSET TO DYSPNOEA 8·0 DAYS [IQR 5·0-13·0]). 26 (63%) OF 41 PATIENTS HAD LYMPHOPENIA. ALL 41 PATIENTS HAD PNEUMONIA WITH ABNORMAL FINDINGS ON CHEST CT. COMPLICATIONS INCLUDED ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (12 [29%]), RNAAEMIA (SIX [15%]), ACUTE CARDIAC INJURY (FIVE [12%]) AND SECONDARY INFECTION (FOUR [10%]). 13 (32%) PATIENTS WERE ADMITTED TO AN ICU AND SIX (15%) DIED. COMPARED WITH NON-ICU PATIENTS, ICU PATIENTS HAD HIGHER PLASMA LEVELS OF IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, AND TNFΑ. THE 2019-NCOV INFECTION CAUSED CLUSTERS OF SEVERE RESPIRATORY ILLNESS SIMILAR TO SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH ICU ADMISSION AND HIGH MORTALITY.

AFFECTED PATIENTS WERE GEOGRAPHICALLY LINKED WITH A LOCAL WET MARKET AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE. NO DATA ON PERSON-TO-PERSON OR NOSOCOMIAL TRANSMISSION HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED TO DATE. IN THIS STUDY, WE REPORT THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL, CLINICAL, LABORATORY, RADIOLOGICAL, AND MICROBIOLOGICAL FINDINGS OF FIVE PATIENTS IN A FAMILY CLUSTER WHO PRESENTED WITH UNEXPLAINED PNEUMONIA AFTER RETURNING TO SHENZHEN, GUANGDONG PROVINCE, CHINA, AFTER A VISIT TO WUHAN, AND AN ADDITIONAL FAMILY MEMBER WHO DID NOT TRAVEL TO WUHAN. PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF GENETIC SEQUENCES FROM THESE PATIENTS WERE DONE. FROM JAN 10, 2020, WE ENROLLED A FAMILY OF SIX PATIENTS WHO TRAVELLED TO WUHAN FROM SHENZHEN BETWEEN DEC 29, 2019 AND JAN 4, 2020. OF SIX FAMILY MEMBERS WHO TRAVELLED TO WUHAN, FIVE WERE IDENTIFIED AS INFECTED WITH THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS. ADDITIONALLY, ONE FAMILY MEMBER, WHO DID NOT TRAVEL TO WUHAN, BECAME INFECTED WITH THE VIRUS AFTER SEVERAL DAYS OF CONTACT WITH FOUR OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS. NONE OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS HAD CONTACTS WITH WUHAN MARKETS OR ANIMALS, ALTHOUGH TWO HAD VISITED A WUHAN HOSPITAL. FIVE FAMILY MEMBERS (AGED 36-66 YEARS) PRESENTED WITH FEVER, UPPER OR LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT SYMPTOMS, OR DIARRHOEA, OR A COMBINATION OF THESE 3-6 DAYS AFTER EXPOSURE. THEY PRESENTED TO OUR HOSPITAL (THE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG-SHENZHEN HOSPITAL, SHENZHEN) 6-10 DAYS AFTER SYMPTOM ONSET. THEY AND ONE ASYMPTOMATIC CHILD (AGED 10 YEARS) HAD RADIOLOGICAL GROUND-GLASS LUNG OPACITIES. OLDER PATIENTS (AGED >60 YEARS) HAD MORE SYSTEMIC SYMPTOMS, EXTENSIVE RADIOLOGICAL GROUND-GLASS LUNG CHANGES, LYMPHOPENIA, THROMBOCYTOPENIA, AND INCREASED C-REACTIVE PROTEIN AND LACTATE DEHYDROGENASE LEVELS. THE NASOPHARYNGEAL OR THROAT SWABS OF THESE SIX PATIENTS WERE NEGATIVE FOR KNOWN RESPIRATORY MICROBES BY POINT-OF-CARE MULTIPLEX RT-PCR, BUT FIVE PATIENTS (FOUR ADULTS AND THE CHILD) WERE RT-PCR POSITIVE FOR GENES ENCODING THE INTERNAL RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE AND SURFACE SPIKE PROTEIN OF THIS NOVEL CORONAVIRUS, WHICH WERE CONFIRMED BY SANGER SEQUENCING. PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF THESE FIVE PATIENTS' RT-PCR AMPLICONS AND TWO FULL GENOMES BY NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING SHOWED THAT THIS IS A NOVEL CORONAVIRUS, WHICH IS CLOSEST TO THE BAT SEVERE ACUTE RESPIATORY SYNDROME (SARS)-RELATED CORONAVIRUSES FOUND IN CHINESE HORSESHOE BATS.

TO INVESTIGATE POSSIBLE VIRUS RESERVOIR, WE HAVE CARRIED OUT COMPREHENSIVE SEQUENCE ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON IN CONJUNCTION WITH RELATIVE SYNONYMOUS CODON USAGE (RSCU) BIAS AMONG DIFFERENT ANIMAL SPECIES BASED ON THE 2019-NCOV SEQUENCE. RESULTS OBTAINED FROM OUR ANALYSES SUGGEST THAT THE 2019-NCOV MAY APPEAR TO BE A RECOMBINANT VIRUS BETWEEN THE BAT CORONAVIRUS AND AN ORIGIN-UNKNOWN CORONAVIRUS. THE RECOMBINATION MAY OCCURRED WITHIN THE VIRAL SPIKE GLYCOPROTEIN, WHICH RECOGNIZES A CELL SURFACE RECEPTOR. ADDITIONALLY, OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT 2019-NCOV HAS MOST SIMILAR GENETIC INFORMATION WITH BAT CORONOVIRUS AND MOST SIMILAR CODON USAGE BIAS WITH SNAKE. TAKEN TOGETHER, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT HOMOLOGOUS RECOMBINATION MAY OCCUR AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE 2019-NCOV CROSS-SPECIES TRANSMISSION.","DEPARTMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY, PEKING UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER SCHOOL OF BASIC MEDICAL SCIENCES, BEIJING, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF SPLEEN AND STOMACH DISEASES, THE FIRST AFFILIATED HOSPITAL OF GUANGXI UNIVERSITY OF CHINESE MEDICINE, NANNING, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, RUIKANG HOSPITAL AFFILIATED TO GUANGXI UNIVERSITY OF CHINESE MEDICINE, NANNING, CHINA.;IMMUNOLOGY INNOVATION TEAM, SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, NINGBO UNIVERSITY, NINGBO, CHINA.;HUBEI ENGINEERING RESEARCH CENTER OF VIRAL VECTOR, WUHAN UNIVERSITY OF BIOENGINEERING, WUHAN, CHINA.","NA",0,"1096-9071","J.

IDENTIFICATION OF THE CAUSATIVE VIRAL PATHOGENS OF RESPIRATORY TRACT VIRAL INFECTIONS IS IMPORTANT TO SELECT AN APPROPRIATE TREATMENT, SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES, STOP THE EPIDEMICS, AND AVOID UNNECESSARY USE OF ANTIBIOTICS. CONVENTIONAL DIAGNOSTIC TESTS, SUCH AS THE ASSAYS FOR RAPID DETECTION OF ANTIVIRAL ANTIBODIES OR VIRAL ANTIGENS, ARE WIDELY USED IN MANY CLINICAL LABORATORIES. WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN TECHNOLOGIES, NEW DIAGNOSTIC STRATEGIES, INCLUDING MULTIPLEX NUCLEIC ACID AMPLIFICATION AND MICROARRAY-BASED ASSAYS, ARE EMERGING. THIS REVIEW SUMMARIZES CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND NOVEL EMERGING DIAGNOSTIC METHODS FOR THE DETECTION OF COMMON RESPIRATORY VIRUSES, SUCH AS INFLUENZA VIRUS, HUMAN RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS, CORONAVIRUS, HUMAN ADENOVIRUS, AND HUMAN RHINOVIRUS. MULTIPLEX ASSAYS FOR SIMULTANEOUS DETECTION OF MULTIPLE RESPIRATORY VIRUSES ARE ALSO DESCRIBED. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT SUCH DATA WILL ASSIST RESEARCHERS AND CLINICIANS TO DEVELOP APPROPRIATE DIAGNOSTIC STRATEGIES FOR TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE DETECTION OF RESPIRATORY VIRUS INFECTIONS.","DEPARTMENT OF CLINICAL MEDICINE, SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY CITY COLLEGE, HANGZHOU, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF NORTH CHINA CROP IMPROVEMENT AND REGULATION, RESEARCH CENTER OF CHINESE JUJUBE, HEBEI AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, BAODING, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF NORTH CHINA CROP IMPROVEMENT AND REGULATION, COLLEGE OF LIFE AND SCIENCE, HEBEI AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, BAODING, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF NORTH CHINA CROP IMPROVEMENT AND REGULATION, COLLEGE OF LIFE AND SCIENCE, HEBEI AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, BAODING, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF NORTH CHINA CROP IMPROVEMENT AND REGULATION, COLLEGE OF LIFE AND SCIENCE, HEBEI AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, BAODING, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF NORTH CHINA CROP IMPROVEMENT AND REGULATION, COLLEGE OF LIFE AND SCIENCE, HEBEI AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, BAODING, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF NORTH CHINA CROP IMPROVEMENT AND REGULATION, COLLEGE OF LIFE AND SCIENCE, HEBEI AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, BAODING, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF NORTH CHINA CROP IMPROVEMENT AND REGULATION, COLLEGE OF LIFE AND SCIENCE, HEBEI AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, BAODING, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF NORTH CHINA CROP IMPROVEMENT AND REGULATION, COLLEGE OF LIFE AND SCIENCE, HEBEI AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, BAODING, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF NORTH CHINA CROP IMPROVEMENT AND REGULATION, COLLEGE OF LIFE AND SCIENCE, HEBEI AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, BAODING, CHINA.;LINDSLEY F.
