## Abstract

This project intends to reproduce and replicate the study by Homolak et al(2020), which investigates how the scientific community have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by quantifying the distribution and availability patterns of the academic information related to COVID-19. The aim of the original study is to assess the quality of the information flow and scientific collaboration under the pandemic. Here, the reproduction part of this project is focused on *validating the correctness of Homolak's method, code, and conclusions, fix potential errors, as well as to evaluate/improve the reproducibility of the entire study*. In the replication part of the project, the original data is replaced with the most updated ones to *compare changes in academic patterns over time and seek for further improvements*.
